Shanna,1/18/2025,When we purchased this product not even the Black Friday sale could come within $50 of the price which made this one a no brainer but we are happy with this choice and have enjoyed watching our son learn and grow on this one. Charges easy and screen time seems like days but in reality I place ours on charge every other night with at least 30 to 50% battery life left after probably 3 hours of screen time (yes educational) and just being turned on. We are using this for multiple apps for school and learning to read. Watching him use this better than I do might be concerning lol.,5,iPad 9th Gen

Kamalakannan Thammireddi Vajram,1/16/2025,"Don't buy apple products from Amazon. One, more chances it might turn out to be defective (Mine had a scree flickering and its operating way slower), second Amazon will no hold on to their return policy. The customer service will always find different ways to end your chat or cancel your return. All you will hear from them is ""Sorry for the inconvenience caused"" and ""That's my limitation and anything else, I have to end this chat or call"". If you keep pursuing they will politely say ""You will get the same information with anyone you call to"", sarcastically nothing you can do. They won't respect their own return agreement on their website. Utter disgrace.I talked to 5 Customer Service agent, 1 Service Specialist and 2 Technical Customer Specialist. Most of them are rude not pointing to the right place or person for information.",1,iPad 9th Gen

Romeo Charlie Actual,1/14/2025,"I got the Apple iPad (9th Generation) for my four-year-old, and it’s been amazing! Everything runs smoothly, and the 10.2-inch Retina Display is perfect for games, videos, and learning apps. The 64GB storage is more than enough for all his apps and some downloads for offline use.What I love most is how easy Apple makes it to manage access with Apple Family. Setting time limits and restricting apps is a breeze, so I don’t have to worry about him spending too much time on the screen or stumbling across something inappropriate.One tip: make sure you get a great case to go with it, especially for kids. It’s worth it for the extra protection against drops and bumps!Highly recommend this iPad for families—it’s a great mix of performance, usability, and security for little ones!",5,iPad 9th Gen

Ricky Smith|Ricky Smith,1/13/2025,The display quality is excellent. There are no issues with connectivity. It’s a good weight and I think the screen is the perfect size for taking on an airplane. Anything bigger and you just start to get too big to carry around. I have the 256GB and I’m glad I got it because the system will run better with more memory to access. If you can pick this up for a couple hundred bucks you won’t be disappointed. Good luck!,5,iPad 9th Gen

Rebecca R,1/7/2025,"When I was researching what new iPad I was going to get, I came across this one by this seller.  I viewed the photos and all on the same page was an image for powerful performance, the all day battery, the 12MP ultra wide front camera along with the smart keyboard and apple pencil  It turns out it did not come with the keyboard or pencil.  Yes, it probably stated what was in the box, but I was focused on the photos.The delivery was awful.  It was marked as 'handed directly to a resident' which was absolutely inaccurate and untrue ---- the box was laying beyond our driveway (which is about 50 feet from our front door) in the road!  This was the most disappointing experience and that it was noted as 'handed directly to a resident' is dishonest.",1,iPad 9th Gen

Charles C.,12/24/2024,We bought two of these iPads for our kids for Christmas. They came very visibly refurbished.

C.M.,9/15/2024,"Bigger and heavier than the iPad Mini's I've owned, from the first generation to the 5th generation.After a few drops of my 5th gen iPad Mini, its display started giltching. I've had it from its release day to present. So it's been a few years. I was going to upgrade to the 6th gen Mini next, but being sixty-ish...... things are harder to see, so I decided a bigger, more productive iPad would be the better buy.This iPad Air M2 11"" is awesome! So many upgrades and definitely a more productive tablet! Reading at night is so much easier. Using a keyboard and typing up reports and ideas is so much better. Gaming is so satisfying and it's just the second day of owning this tablet!The journey from the very first iPad Mini to 3rd and 5th generation to this, just astounds me! And to think it all started with a Kindle for reading.I highly recommend the iPad Air M2 11"" and may, in a few years, upgrade to an iPad Pro in the future!",5,iPad Air 11inch M2
Shelley,10/24/2024,"I recently purchased a new IPad Air M2 to upgrade from a generation 5 IPad.  So far, it has been a seamless experience.  I am still using the older IPad for a second screen or for listening to music or streaming, but the new IPad has pretty much taken over the du ties of my MacBook Pro too!  I purchased an Apple Pencil for work and it has worked out pretty well so far.  It is nice being able to write again.  My fingers were getting tired of the typing motion so it will be nice to switch between the two mediums.  I highly recommend the new IPad Air 11 inch M2.  It makes me feel all grown up and super productive!  : )",5,iPad Air 11inch M2
CCD,11/24/2024,"I own a regular iPad and a 13” IPad Pro.  The iPad Air is replacing my regular iPad.  The reason for replacing my regular iPad is that my iPad is old, the battery does not hold a charge as long as I would like and the touch screen was getting inconsistent to my touch.  The iPad was slowly dying and I chose to get a deal with Black Friday as opposed to waiting for the device to fail completely.You might ask why I didn’t just use my iPad Pro.  The reason is simple: the iPad Pro is bigger and heavier and I added the Magic Keyboard, which while a nice keyboard is heavy.  I found myself using my regular iPad because it was just lighter and more easily portable.  I still use the iPad Pro, but I just don’t like walking around with it.  For light use, the bigger screen just doesn’t matter that much to me.I went for the iPad Air primarily because the device was on sale for $100 off and the base Air has more storage than the regular iPad.  Also, instead of getting a Magic Keyboard, I got a Logitech combo case and keyboard that is much lighter.  This is an iPad I want to walk around with.  In retrospect, I question the use case for the iPad Pro.  At that size and weight (including the Magic Keyboard), I’d just get a Mac.Other than that, the Air is a regular iPad with more memory for most people.  It seems to work just like my old iPad, just shiny, new and a bit faster.  Biggest different is that the finger print scanner is on the side of the Air, which is nicer and the screen is nicer.  But there are no “day and night” differences.It works the way it should.  Seems to connect better than my old iPad.  I also got a better case this time.  The old one was more bulky and connected via Bluetooth and there were always delays in connecting with the iPad.  The new case is designed for the Air, connects the same way as the Magic Keyboard and does not need to be separately charged.  All the things that irritated me about my old iPad are now gone and I am now a “happy camper.”  As for anyone who has a working iPad, I cannot tell you that you will see much difference from your old iPad.  Aside from the issues with my old iPad, I would not have made this purchase.  The improvements in the iPad are just too incremental to recommend upgrading for the sake of upgrading.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2

The Mizes,1/12/2025,"I purchased a two 11""  iPad Airs, one 128MB and one 256 MB. I also purchased the iPen to replace an older generation iPad and pen as I was always running out of storage space on the old one. My primary for upgrading is that I have transitioned much of my workflow, journaling, and note taking to a digital format,, so I wanted something that I could use as a portable notebook, planner, etc.PROS: I love that it has so much more storage and a stronger processor so it easily flows between apps witout lagging. The display is also much sharper than my old mode. I also love that my iPen can now charge just by being magnetically attached to the ipad itself without having to plug it in.CONS: The only real issue I have had with this new device is that even though I primarily purchased this device for journaling and notetaking, the device gets hot across the top when using notetaking apps, specifically Good Notes. Upon googling this, it appears this is a known issue with these devices. I'm hoping that it is something that can be fixed with a software update.Overall, I really do love the new device and it would get 5 stars if they fix the heat issue while using Good Notes.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
Mike G,1/6/2025,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. This is her 3rd Ipad. I'm an Android guy (Samsung) so I can't say too much.

Kate Lynn,11/4/2024,"While I love my new iPad Air, I did have a problem with the file transfer from my iPad 2018 to the iPad Air 2024. The QuickStart file transfer seemed to be going well until the new iPad Air wanted to update to iOS 18 during this process.It did not give me the option to opt out so I started the download. It seemed to download OK, but then did not give me the option to install later or install now. The only option it gave was to install. I hit install and that began my problem. It ran for an hour and a half and still did not complete the install and though I gave it more time, it still did not finish the process.I googled the problem online and found out that this was an issue which could only be resolved by stopping the process. I turned off the iPad Air and when I restarted it I had to reset it and then check for updates. Then gave me an option to update to 17.7.1 or iOS 18. I chose the former as that was the iOS system on my old iPad. I then tried the QuickStart program again, and it worked flawlessly.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
Patrick Walker,7/23/2024,"So for years I have been wanting Apple to make a tablet that is a perfect replacement for my Macbook Air. This to me is exactly that. With the keyboard and case, this is essentially an 11"" laptop with a removable touchscreen screen. A dream come true in a lot of ways for artists, writers, and teachers like myself. One warning though, it ONLY works with the new Apple Pencil Pro and the Apple Pencil (USB-C). It does NOT work with the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) that worked on the previous iPad Air 4th and 5th gen.I send this as a warning because I have the iPad mini (6th gen) and Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) and they work brilliantly together for what I need. When I got this new iPad Air M2 The Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) was not working on it. It was not securely connecting magnetically where it should and it was not registering on the iPad M2 when I did get it to slightly connect. I thought it was the iPad Air M2 that was busted but after a call with Apple themselves this morning it was cleared up. Late last night in my panic and frustration with buying a new device that seemed to be defective I began the process of a return. Amazon does not offer exchanged on this product. This morning though when I called Apple I was told that the description on the apple site says ""Supports Apple Pencil Pro. Supports Apple Pencil (USB?C)"" and I figured it would work with the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) as well but it does not. Return was canceled and I ordered the Apple Pencil pro.So if you, like me, have the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) and it works on previous models of iPads perfectly and it charges perfectly and it does NOT work this new model iPad Air M2, you're not crazy and your new iPad is not broken, you just need either the Apple Pencil Pro or the Apple Pencil (USB-C).It is still an amazing device. Truly spectacular for what I need. I love love love it for sure, don't get me wrong. Apple just makes this stupid decisions and I want to reach out and people know they might need to get yet another apple device to use with this new apple device. I assume a LOT of people are going to be getting this iPad Air M2 model to replace their previous iPad air 4th or 5th generation model. Logic would say that the previous amazing top of the line apple pencil that worked on the previous models iPad Air would work on the new M2 model. Nope. Just a heads up. 5 stars because the device is still incredible -1 star because Apple is a pain in the arse at times.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
F1racer,11/17/2024,"Amazon had the 5th gen Ipad air on sale a couple of months ago, and given how fast the M1 chip was, I thought it'd be fast enough, but it wasn't.  very strange.  the 5th gen also had another issue, the base unit only comes with 64GB, which makes it obsolete right after you buy it, or you'd have to spend +100 to get the 256GB.  The 6th gen M2 was perfect, the M2 processor proved noticeably faster even in everyday tasks, although the CPU itself isn't much faster, but I guess add the extra and faster GPU cores, and NPU for Apple intelligence, and at 128GB, which is all that I needed, ended up being the same as the gen 5 256G variant.  I'm glad I waited a bit, and got the M2 Air.  The only reason it didn't get a full 5 stars is because it lacked 120hz refresh, and only had 2 speakers, no face ID.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
no.bookend.in.sight,12/1/2024,"This is my very first brand new iPad and I love it. The tablet is the solid quality I expect from Apple, and the storage will be fine for me as I don’t have a lot of apps on it yet. It does come loaded with a full suite of apple apps, which is a great way to get started. I was able to use my iPhone to set it up and it only took me a few minutes. The bright and large screen is much easier on my eyes than my iPhone. It is a bit heavier than I expected once I put it in my case, but I don’t mind because of the size and protective quality of the case.

Bruce C,10/22/2024,"I was in the market for a smaller iPad, I previously had a 13 inch iPad Pro but found that it was actually TOO big for what I used it for. I was excited when I saw Apple announce the new iPad Mini 7th Generation. but when I looked at the actual specs, it was actually really disappointing.And then I started looking into the iPad Air 11-inch with M2 chip. For an extra 50 dollars compared to the $499 price tag for the new Mini, I get a much better chip (M2 vs. A17), a slightly bigger screen, a landscape positioned front facing camera for video calls, and overall just a more powerful machine.Let's face it, unless you are a video editor or use your iPad as your computer replacement, a M2 chip is WAYYYY more powerful than what your average user uses their iPad for. I mainly use it to consume entertainment, fire off iMessages with my friends, watch YouTube, surf the web, or play a few games, and the iPad Air M2 does all of this seamlessly. And the 11 inch form factor is perfect when you are lying in bed or traveling.At $550 (the current price on Amazon, and what I paid for) the Air is an absolute no brainer and should be future proof for a good 3-5 years.Buy the iPad Air with confidence!",5,iPad Air 11inch M2

Her's Honest Reviews,8/30/2024,"I'm a professional artist and really wanted this to be the best thing since slice bread. It works good and I love the convenience. I don't think the technology is as good as a cintiq. When I draw on a wacom I feel like it's my actual line. I think the smoothing on the Ipad can be adjusted in procreate further, but the cintiq comes out of the box that way. Yes, in terms of being able to work without cords; it is hands down, hard to beat right now.If you want the line you're trying to draw to be what you want, I don't think it's quite there yet. I try to draw the same line on top of each other and it's never quite the exact line I'm trying to draw. I want to be able to draw using just pressure to get the line width I'm expecting. I'm sure others who have worked with the Ipad longer know the settings to get what they want, but still right now it doesn't compare to a cintiq. I will stick to my cintiq for my professional work and I hope eventually the ipad gets better. Granted, I don't know the difference between this Ipad Air and the Ipad pro, but I would be surprised it was a huge difference.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2

Hyrum,6/7/2024,"I bought the iPad Air to replace a 2018 iPad Pro which had some earned honorable battle scars, dents, and scratches, but was valiantly chugging along with an aging battery.  I was surprised that for my daily use I could see no detectable differences in display or speed.  I was especially surprised that an obsidian display of some 8000 notes  took about the same time to form on each machine.  I have not timed it, but then I am concerned with perception and not numbers.  A imperceptible difference is not a difference.The two machines are now my constant companions.  I use one while the other charges and the major difference is the color of their cover.  Instead of a replacement I feel I purchased a younger, companionable, clone.I am satisfied with my purchase.  The combination of Apple tablet, watch, and phone continues to be unsurpassed, though I have replaced my MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with a Linux laptop.I am undecided about the new Apple Pencil. My second generation pencil does not work with the air, but a no-name pencil I purchased from Amazon in 2022 works intermittently.  I can usually get it to work again by closing and reopening the program I am using.  The pencil is still on sale for $9.99 but I will probably purchase the $15.99 model with fast charge and palm rejection before considering the generation 3 pencil.I am a college full professor and use these devices primarily for research, writing, preparing and delivering classes, and general office functions.  Number crunching is done on the laptop.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
BobR52,9/16/2024,Time for me to replace my aging Apple products this year.  My 2019 iPad still works but I really underestimated the amount of storage I needed.  32GB was fine for my first iPad in 2014 but very inadequate for today's demands.  It was becoming pretty useless and I was unable to update the software without having to make more storage available.  So instead I bought one of the new iPad Airs.  I contemplated the Pro model but decided to also update my 12 year old MacBook so decided to go with the Air 11 in model -- really a fine product.  Great speed and screen resolution is superb.  I use it every day reading the news with my coffee.  I opted for Apple Care + as well -- through iPad settings.  I guess next up is a replacement for my iPhone11.,5,iPad Air 11inch M2

srf,7/13/2024,"I had an IPad years ago, and while a nice tablet, it frustrated me how difficult it was to load music and videos on it from my PC.  I stayed away for a long time, but thought I'd give Apple one more try.  Apple has totally fixed that irritation since then, as file transfers are much easier in Itunes with this tablet and PC.  Another thing that kept me away from Apple was the lack of expandable storage (micro SD slot) in every phone and tablet.  An SD slot should always be included on any tablet over $300, but the lack of one makes you upgrade sooner, whuch is a garbage move by Apple.  Combined with Apple's ridiculous premium $ they charged for higher storage capacity, I just stayed away.  With this latest tablet, Apple finally charged a somewhat fair price for 256GB in storage, so I bought it.  Gotta say, I love it now.  ITunes works easily with my PC.  Plenty of storage at 256GB.  Nice and bright screen.  Fingerprint ID button placement seems a little odd, but you get used to it quickly.  It works every time.  Long battery life.  Includes fantastic M2 chip, which pretty much destroys every Android tablet chip.  All in all, a ery nice tablet.  Now Apple, about that micro SD slot......",5,iPad Air 11inch M2

I'd say actually purchase the iPad and stop flirting with the competition. It's great, I know the price tag be steep but once you have it, it's the immediate go-to. I've wasted so much time hassling other tablets to remotely have it feel natural and apple has it done, in the bag.

Another thing is that it heats up sometimes, I've read it's an issue that should be fixed with an update, and it's usually fixed after restarting it or leaving it alone for a while, so that part is annoying.Apart from that, I love it and I think this is the best option I could have purchased with my budget!",4,iPad Air 11inch M2

I also opted for the monthly coverage plan, which costs $8.07, and I believe it’s worth it for peace of mind in case of any damage or issues.The only downsides are that the packaging felt a bit cheap, and the included charger is low quality. However, these are minor drawbacks, and overall, I highly recommend the Amazon phone store.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
Cold in Upstate New York,12/28/2024,"I was a skeptic about ordering a refurbished iPhone.  I had an iPhone 8 and didn't want to spend a fortune on a new iPhone.  My friend talked me into purchasing a refurbished iPhone from Amazon.  Reluctantly, I ordered an iPhone 15 since it was rated Excellent and the price was right.  It was sent via FedlEx and I was required to sign for it.  It arrived quickly and was well packaged.  It is in excellent condition and doesn't look used at all.  It was very easy to set up and within a few hours was using it like I've had it forever.  I am very pleased with my new iPhone and highly recommend Amazon's refurbished products.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
Gabi|Gabi,1/17/2025,"This phone is exactly what I paid for. There are only a few tiny scratches on the screen, but you can hardly see them - I only noticed it while i was cleaning the screen to put on the screen protector. Functions week. I transferred all my data from my previous iPhone using ICloud and set up the eSIM super quickly and easily. Phone calls were easy to hear and they could hear me well. I haven’t listened to music on it yet but I’m sure it’s good! Good price for a good product, battery is perfect! It also arrived quicker than expected so that was wonderful.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
Carmenn????|Carmenn????,1/17/2025,"This iphone was in excellent condition. There was no noticeable damage to it at all. The only thing that went wrong here was the delivery process but that was 100% NOT this company’s fault. It was drawing near the holidays and FedEx was “ allegedly” super busy and was delaying my package for multiple days. I reached out to the company and they gave great advice and help me, so big shout out to them. I enjoy my phone and had it for a full month now. There’s no complications and it’s a great iPhone.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
Paul Williams,12/30/2024,"It was time for Mimi to get a new phone as her Iphone X was starting to give her problems. As everyone knows now, if Mimi is not happy, only grandkids are happy. Mimi needs long battery life and storage for more photos and videos.The camera is awesome and easy to take great pics with Mimi now acting more like Ansel adams. Low-light shots? Perfectly detailed. Portrait mode? Like having a professional photographer in your pocket.The battery easily lasts a full day, even with Mimi use. Now, she has very few apps in her life and in the past her battery drain was the biggest issue. That is now corrected and Mimi is happy.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

Katherine B.,1/9/2025,"I always buy my phones and this was my first purchase of a refurbished phone. For all I can tell the phone is brand new and was easy to set up. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars not 5 is because the charger and cord that came with it are not compatible with the iPhone i bought, but on a good note it does work with my iPad. I had to go out and purchase a compatible charger and cord for the iPhone.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
ARK,1/12/2025,"Had a little trouble transferring to eSIM, but it ended up all working out. There was a minor cosmetic issue on the bottom right corner where the aluminum had been dented, but other than that I am satisfied. Much cheaper and than buying even Apple Refurbished, and the worst case scenario is that you get a dud and return it with Amazon's forgiving return policy.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

Katt,11/25/2024,"Phone was as listed, however they do not come with chargers that work with Apple products. The seller does respond quickly, however after my second charger from them not working on any of my Apple products, I’ve come to the conclusion that they just don’t offer chargers that are compatible with my phone. Just make sure you have a charger ready to go for your new phone, and you’ll have no problems. Over all, I suppose I can’t complain too much, I got a good phone for not a huge hit on my bank account. I’d still purchase from them in the future.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
Garraat Somboon,1/14/2025,First time getting a renewed device and have 0 regrets. Aside from some minor scuffs on the phone it's nothing too jarring. Can't really complain about it either since it came with 100% battery health. Overall well worth the money.,5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

The phone was in great condition, came with a charger, and had a great battery life. Phones go down in value so quickly, so I just can’t stomach paying full price for a brand new one when a used one like this works perfectly! This phone was for my friend, and he loves it.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
Cerulean5,1/13/2025,it’s a great refurbished like new phoneMy only complaint is that it wasn’t a smooth transfer of service I had to contact Amazon live chat twice. I had to contact Apple twice and I had to contact TMOBILE twice and then a third time I had to drive over to T-Mobile to actually transfer my service for my iPhone 6 SE to my iPhone 15. I am currently pretty happy with the iPhone 15 sometimes the screen Gets frozen not sure if that’s because I have to keep updating the iOS. I guess Apple phones are all the same. I’ve never had an android so I have no idea how to compare it but so far the photos are much clearer and work much better.,3,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

No original box or packaging,  ""how to use"" booklet, and charge cord was very worn. The protective phone packaging for normal, much less abusive handling was scant...it stated it was ""refurbished"" so I was expecting to receive a much more professional presentation.

frankie,10/20/2024,"So far everything works very smoothly, battery is fine, no serious chips just a tiny tiny dent on the back. Only thing is the screen was obviously what was replaced because it’s very warped, but it doesn’t effect the actual display or touch so unless that would bother you it’s a non issue. another thing, if you get the 15 DO NOT do the data transfer on set up then update, the update will not install. either set it up without or do icloud, then do the update from the settings, then do your data transfer, i promise it will actually save you time in the long run",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

Madeline|Madeline,6/12/2024,"Upgraded from my iPhone 11 that was suffering due to poor battery health after many years of use. Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

    I purchased two renewed iPhone 15 devices (128GB), both in flawless condition—100% battery health, no scratches, and under Apple warranty until September 2025. Performance on both phones is exceptional, everything was butterysmooth, 2day shipping and well packaged. Although I was initially hesitant about DirectCertified due to mixed reviews, their prompt customer service reassured me. Overall, an excellent purchase and great value for both devices!",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

After researching renewed options from different sites this option came up as the best priced for the best quality. I’ve bought renewed items before from others sellers / companies and have had issues, so I was a little nervous. When the phone arrived I was shocked at the quality. It looked brand new. No scratches or any issues at all. I will never buy a brand new phone again when I can buy it for half the price for the same quality. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE / PRODUCT",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

Leslie Berlin|Leslie Berlin,6/5/2024,"It was time for me to upgrade my old iPhone 7 since it was not updating to the latest iOS. I researched and decided I got the best bang for my buck if I went for the iPhone 15 rather than the iPhone 13. The quality of the unlocked refurbished phone is outstanding. It's just like new except for the packaging. I especially appreciate the much longer battery life as my previous phone I had to recharge constantly during the day. On this one the battery lasts all day. I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera often but it seems there are a few nice options on there. The extra black space at the top of the phone shows any extra application you may be using in tandem with what's on the face of the phone. This is really handy, for example, if you're using the Google navigation and go away from that to check your messages.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

The battery charged to 100%, showed 6 cycles and there were no bumps, bruises or knots that indicated hard use or wear and tear—just a barely noticeable nick on the screen. . Transferring data from my 11Pro to the 15 was fast and easy. The only challenge I experienced was installing the ESim card and my carrier helped with that.  So far, I haven’t experienced problems with the applications I use most often.  My tablet and watch connected easily and I have twice the capacity of my old phone. After reading about the renew program, I felt much safer than going through other Marketplaces where there is no guarantee for the product you purchase.Winning!",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

colonelwa|colonelwa,6/6/2024,"I love my Kindles, I've had several of them since they first came out.  Still use the latest version daily but I needed either an iPad or a true Android device to run a couple of specific Aps.  Couldn't get the aps to work properly on a ""google play cracked"" Kindle, didn't want to spend $500 on an iPad.  Ordered this Lenovo based on reviews, research and recommendations.  Exactly what I needed/wanted!  Fast, light, cheap - couldn't ask for anything more.  Came with a pretty good case but I upgraded to a ""child proof"" case since I use the tablet to do field recordings and carry it with me most of the day.  Wanted to downsize from my current 11-inch Kindle and this is as small as I will ever go but the display is large enough with great color/resolution.  Battery life seems to be fantastic, I use it to occasionally browse or check email or weather, but mostly to capture data transmissions via Bluetooth and I go 3-4 days before having to recharge it..Picture is of the tablet atop my Kindle and work iPad and then laptop.  Super light, small enough to slip in a jacket pocket.  Haven't found a single thing to complain about in the 3 month's I've owned it.",5,Tab M9

Endocrantz,3/1/2024,"I've used some sketchy tablets in my day. I did feel I could be gaining more experience with that when I picked this up on sale a few months ago. I've been quite pleasantly surprised.There are quite a few negative reviews out there. The storage space is tighter than I like, but honestly adding more applications and junk defeats its purpose. Other than that, I think reviewers are expecting $1,000 tablet performance and graphics. That's not what the tab m9 is. If they want that, they'll have to pay. Similarly, the camera is mediocre by today's standards, but I have a Pixel that has a fantastic camera. I don't need another. That's all I can think to say to knock it.I've watched movies, read stories, played logic games (nothing graphicly intense) although I don't really play computer games. Browsing the web and social media are pleasant experiences.I'm taking it travelling. I'll watch a movie or two on my flight. Resolution is great for the screen dimensions. I can VPN into work, use ssh, and get a shell on machines I manage if something comes up. It does everything I need and everything runs smoothly. I don't try to crush it, I just use it.Temper your expectations and enjoy this little tablet. It is a compromise tablet for the price point. I keep it updated, running android 13. It's a pretty good deal.",5,Tab M9
James M.,10/14/2024,"I purchased this tablet for media consumption as well as to run my laser engraving software.  It does both just fine.  This is the first tablet I've ever owned that wasn't a Kindle, so my experience is pretty limited.  All I can say is that it will run Microsoft 365 just fine, plays media just fine, with some decent audio from the speakers, btw, and runs my laserpecker software without issue.It feels premium with its metal and glass design.  The screen is quite vivid.  Performance is snappy and meets my needs.If you're looking for a basic tablet that won't annoy you with terrible performance, picture, and sound, then this tablet will check all your boxes.Just don't expect it to be a high end gamer, and you're not going to be disappointed",5,Tab M9
Justin Oxentine-Salig,9/30/2023,"I recently purchased a Lenovo tablet, and I wanted to share my experience with it. First and foremost, I want to clarify that my review is not directed at the seller; they did their job in delivering the product promptly. It's important to note that sellers have no control over the product itself.I decided on a Lenovo tablet because I was in need of a device for both personal and work use, and Lenovo has a reputation for producing quality PCs and laptops. I carefully examined the product specs on the Lenovo website, which indicated that the tablet had 32GB of storage, expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card.However, when the tablet arrived and I went through the standard setup process, including adding my Google account and performing necessary updates, I was shocked to discover that I only had 17GB of storage space remaining. This was before even installing the apps I had planned to use.I inserted a micro SD card and attempted to set it as expandable storage on top of the internal storage, but to my disappointment, the option was nowhere to be found in the settings. After some research on the Lenovo website, I learned that the storage expansion feature had been removed in the latest system update, rendering the micro SD card usable only for photo storage.This left me frustrated as it's nearly impossible to work with only 17GB of available storage on a tablet. The operating system and updates had already consumed nearly half of the 32GB the tablet originally came with. Consequently, I promptly requested a refund and opted to purchase a Samsung Galaxy Tab with 128GB of storage.In conclusion, if you're in the market for a tablet, I would strongly advise against considering this Lenovo tablet. The unexpected removal of the storage expansion feature was a major disappointment, and the limited storage capacity severely hindered its usability for my needs.",1,Tab M9
John M.,10/26/2023,"|The media could not be loaded.|So this is a nice little tablet, I will say the folio case it comes with is okay but I would not trust it to actually protect this thing, the screen protector it came with is straight garbage and came with no tools to ensure a good application I honestly would rather it not have come with a screen protector at all.As for performance, I got this mostly as a streaming tablet but also for a little emulation and I am happy to report if you want this for emulation it is a great value get it. It can play light ps2 and gamecube games easily like Luigi's Mansion, Mario Kart, and Monster Hunter All play fine, and every system before gamecube like dreamcast, psp, n64 will all work perfectly.For video streaming I was actually dissapointef which is why I will probably end up returning this. I always watch YouTube videos at 2x and this thing it depends on the video but I would say about 50% of videos if you turn on 2x speed it runs at literally like 15fps and looks horrible, yourube was my primary reason for buying this so it just does not make sense to keep it. Netflix, hulu, disney, all seem to work fine and it does not make much sense why youtube has this issue, but it does. Also whenever an ad plays on YouTube it exits full-screen for some reason which is super annoying. I added a video showing 2x video on YouTube. In this instance it looked just fine until an ad played, then after the ad the franerate dropped to this like 10 or 15fps and looks terrible",3,Tab M9

Lost in paradise,11/20/2023,"So after submitting 2 support tickets and one ""help me"" message from their app on the tablet, I finally got a response to the support ticket that they were sending a replacement ""part"". This ""part"" arrived and it was a new tablet. I wasn't sure a new tablet would fix this since it looked like a software problem, so I was skeptical. I moved everything to the new tablet and it IS actually working much better. I can run all of my apps, except the one solitaire app still gets killed by the tablet. But I found the same game by another developer and it works fine. So I can live with one app not working vs maybe 4 that weren't on my old tablet. Maybe there was indeed some glitch in the hardware somewhere.So I'm raising my rating for their willingness to send a new tablet, which fixed things to the point I can live with.****Original Review****Bought this tablet in June so I've had it 5 months. This tablet initially seemed great, especially for the money and the fact that finding a decent tablet in this size range is almost impossible. It was working great until it didn't. So now I have to give the tablet only 1 star. This is mainly for the software that Lenovo has installed and which you CANNOT see, uninstall or control. It happened after their latest update.The system has a built-in memory management app that you cannot see and cannot control. After the last update, this app has gone on steroids and is very aggressive. It will shut down apps while you are using them or sometimes even before they fully open. Yes, that's right. You click on the app, you see it starting, then boom, it is is gone. I'm not talking graphic-heavy gaming apps. I'm talking solitaire card games and match-3 games. If you google this, you will find many angry posts about this and Lenovo's responses have been the typical, ""well, it is a system app so you can't do anything about it...too bad so sad.""So some apps work and some don't. I've contacted Lenovo via their app on the tablet and twice via their warrant support website since my tablet is still under warranty.  ZERO RESPONSES.  Obviously, Lenovo has no intention of addressing this issue or even any warranty issues. So buy at your own risk cuz once you buy it, you are on your own.",4,Tab M9
AHa|AHa,8/23/2023,"So I got this tablet a little while ago and here are my first impressions.I found the Lenovo M9 at 9” to be comparable with the few small android budget tablets that I've worked with over the last few years.  With its 5:3 aspect ratio, this M9 tablet sits very nicely on my palm & its very comfortable to work with.The frame – is made of metal & edges are hardly noticeable. Overall it has a very modern look and feel.Display – with its 1340x800 resolution and 368 lux, the M9 has a comparatively bright display but it’s still kind of dark when taken outside.  Indoor, this tablet has a very good contrast ratio with strong bright colors.Performance – With its MediaTek Helios G80 I had no issues opening several apps & generally transition from one page to next was very smooth.  Surfing the web was also generally good but this 4 year old SoC (system on a chip) has its limitation especially when playing games (some games couldn’t be played at all).  The same goes for working with memory intensive apps like video or sound editing.Speakers – Sound quality was surprisingly good for such an inexpensive tablet.  The stereo speaker were decent but still there were hardly any bass but then again most people probably use its 3.5 mm (or Bluetooth) to play music with a nicer (more capable) earphone or headphone.The Camera - M9 comes with 2 MP front facing camera and an 8MP rear camera.  Frankly the cameras are good for only snap shots & video conferencing as photos taken by this tablet look mostly washed out and low light photos looked grainy.  The same thing is true when taking videos which is generally adequate in good lighting condition but it can’t cope with low light conditions.Battery – This tablet comes with a 5100 mAh battery which is good enough for watching movies at mid-brightness for about 5 hours (& while connected to WIFI).  However watching movies at maximum brightness will significantly cut it to about 3.5 hours.  That said, it can be fully charged with a 10 watt charger in about 3 hours.Lenovo Tab M9 is a good affordable tablet that is modern looking (I really like the metal body) and is a good compromise between bigger tablets & tiny ones that often don’t come with a lot of features.  I only wished that it also had a LTE build-in so that my kids could watch their shows in the car so to keep them occupied.",4,Tab M9

Elizabeth Marie,11/25/2024,"My wife needed a new tablet for when we travel. I have a Lenovo laptop so I went with this little gem. I am an Apple user usually, but this tablet was easy to use, has a beautiful screen, is light weight and functional. Connects to WiFi quickly without issues. The touch screen works perfect. It even came preloaded with some fun time suck game. I would say this tablet would even be user friendly for kids should your little one need a tablet.",5,Tab M9
Alicia,11/27/2023,"I picked this up this past week during the Black Friday sale, so I haven't had much time to play around with it yet. It's a cheap tablet, so my expectations weren't high. It can be slow in some cases, sometimes taking a little bit to load up some of the larger (read: Google) apps, but it's nothing beyond what I expected. It can play what few mobile games I play just fine, and play local videos and stream just fine too. My OnePlus Nord N200 phone has similar specs, just with a smaller screen, and the speeds are comparable. Entirely usable outside of some unique cases.It probably won't be great as a drawing tablet, but I'll be giving it a try anyway once I manage to pick up a decent passive stylus. I'm only using it to learn basics, so I'm able to keep my expectations reasonable. (For the record, this tablet doesn't support any active stylus types other than regular old Bluetooth. I figure I'd wait on purchasing an active stylus until I can also purchase a good tablet/2-in-1 to use with it.)I have a lot of issues with some changes that were made to Android 12L/13, but that's not really an issue with Lenovo, and from my understanding, they actually waited until the Android 13 update to implement the Android 12L taskbar, so good on them for holding out until they were sure it wasn't going away. I'm not counting that against Lenovo here.But that brings up the other reason I got it. I'm experienced with installing custom ROMs, and name brands like this one tend to have good support for them. The Developer Options section in the Settings has the toggle to unlock the bootloader, so it should be relatively simple for custom ROMs to be made for it. It may only have 3GB of RAM, but so does my OnePlus Nord N200, and that has a ton of ROMs for it.Obviously, doing such a thing isn't for the inexperienced. But I'm not, and so while I can only afford a budget tablet, getting this over, say, a generic Blackview tablet that might have more RAM for the same price, is still the better option in the end due to the longer OS support length.",4,Tab M9
debicga,9/8/2024,The only reason I bought this is my current nook tablet can not update the software so I can't get any of my new books. I wanted a tablet that was a bit bigger than the Samsung tablet I have and the size was perfect. I'm guessing Barnes & Noble has blocked nook from Lenovo tablets as that is what they currently sell as the nook branded tablet. I just spent hours getting my tablet configured and I am so unhappy right now.I am going to try and return but not sure if I can.The tablet itself is pretty awesome though and I would definitely keep it if I could download the nook app.,4,Tab M9

Brian in NH,1/7/2024,"I've had many Lenovo tablets. They're cheap and I've typically gotten them to last about three years. They're not for gaming are extensive streaming, but they're better than Amazon's stuff because at least they run Android properly.For my purposes, it's for reading the news, a bit of simple games from the Play store, managing my bills, and listening to music. Nothing more. Nothing less.So far this meets expectations and the included folio case was a nice plus. But the screen protector included? Total crap. I tried getting bubbles out for an hour and the thing was still disgusting looking. For my use, this spends 95% of its life on my nightstand so I doubt I'll care. But for those who genuinely need a screen protector, you'll have to find something else as what's in the box is worthless.",4,Tab M9

CE,7/28/2023,"This review is for the Lenovo Tab M9. I noticed the reviews seem to combine both the M8 and M9. As far as the M9, I purchased the tablet during prime day for $109. For the price, you will not get a better tablet. Sure, Amazon fire tablets sometimes are cheaper, but do not offer full access to the google play store and performance. The M9 offers good performance for the price. Web browsing, and light multitasking with split screen is possible. Also, some light gaming is possible with the right settings. Of course, when compared to an iPad mini 6 (which I own) or a more expensive android tablet, the M9 will be beaten. However, I recommend the M9 if you need an entry level tablet with full access to the google play store. The screen is plenty bright and it has good built quality.As far as the included folio case, the magnets are not very strong, so it does not stay closed. Also the screen protector is plastic and flimsy. I ended up purchasing a glass tempered screen protector and am using the folio case until more are released with better form factors. Skip the M8, which is abysmally slow now and the screen is dim (I owned the third generation M8). Just be aware that the internal storage of the M9 is  limited, so if you have a lot of apps, you may use up a lot of storage quick. I use it mainly to stream YouTube, Netflix, etc and web browsing. I’ve also used it to video conference through zoom.",5,Tab M9
Conrail Quality|Conrail Quality,2/8/2024,"I bought this to replace an aging Lenovo tablet I’d purchased 4 years ago during the pandemic. It was easy to set up, and I synced it to another android device. I’ll primarily use this for watching Disney Plus or Netflix, reading, or playing an occasional game while I’m on the road and traveling for work. Doesn’t have a ton of storage space, but it suits my needs. Battery charges quickly and has decent battery life. You can certainly buy a much higher quality tablet or an iPad, but then again, you’re spending a lot more for those.

brandon heer,1/24/2024,"I bought this as an e-reader and for the occasional streaming/light gaming. I use the app ReadEra (not a fan of Kindle) and I couldn't be happier. With the brightness turned to minimal (you don't need much for reading), I get 20+ hours easily. Streaming gets me between 3-6 depending on brightness. The included case is great quality for protection against scratches in your bag, ease of holding, and auto sleep when closed - but in no way is this going to save your tablet from a fall off the table.*This tablet is going to need a couple minutes booting to full speed when powering up. This isn't the case when waking form sleep mode - it's ready to go automatically. But expect some patience when cycling the power.*This tablet should be good for live android updates until at least next year, but runs great out of the box for the basics.*I've also dabbled with some low end retri emulation (GBA, SNES, and even PS1) - all working great especially when connected to power. The bluetooth pairs with a controller no problem.I'd buy this tablet again, especially if its on sale.",5,Tab M9

J Ken Kuzenski,7/23/2023,"I've owned a BUNCH of lenovo tablets; I just got this one because my 10"" tablet isn't comfortable for reading while holding it with one hand.  This 9"" is just right in terms of size, for me.  The screen isn't quite as crisp as I'd like for reading, but it's still better than many other tablets I've had.  That is my first complaint, the second is that  I can't format a new 128G micro SD as internal storage, only as ""portable storage.""  (Lenovo's help and specifications are insanely nonspecific at times.)Those are my only complaints and overall this is  the best tablet I've had in a long time.  The case is great, mine came with a little folding cover (can't promise they all do), which is VERY useful and effective though it's just plain plastic.  My apps run very well, not too much proprietary idiotware added to the OS as far as I can tell, and all the controls and functions are fine.Overall this tablet gets a very solid ""A"" and just misses an ""A-plus.""

Again, put it in perspective of the class it's in.I definitely would buy this again. As a matter of fact, this is my 2nd Lenovo tablet because the first one I purchased a few years ago is still great -  but using for a different purpose, so I needed another, so I turned to this smaller one.",5,Tab M9
Amazonian,11/11/2023,"There is a lot to like about this tablet. It's nearly the perfect size to use as a reader and for general entertainment. It feels solid and is suitably fast for general infotainment functions. Some reviewers have even reported being able to use it for light gaming. I would not expect it to perform as well for multitasking/productivity type functionality. This was going to be my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for an inexpensive but functional tablet for the next year or two. I was also ready to get one for a family member who is not especially tech savvy when, out of the blue, the tablet offered an Android 13 upgrade. Wow! So soon after procuring this tablet. Nice! Well, as it turns out, Lenovo's implementation of Android 13 on this device includes a completely pointless taskbar. This taskbar is great at getting in the way and provides little additional value when you are using this tablet as... a tablet. It might have some use if you were using this tablet for a productivity device - but this is not a tablet that is especially fit for productivity apps. This taskbar severely impedes using navigation buttons and cannot be hidden when using them. So, if you want the taskbar out of the way, you must use the default launcher and set navigation for gestures. Only once this is done, may you use a third party launcher. You can then swipe down to make the taskbar disappear. It will reappear after restarting the tablet or after unlocking. Then this workaround must be done again. Other manufacturers allow users to disable the taskbar in the interface. Lenovo's Android 13 implementation for this tablet does not allow this. I am hoping this option becomes available in a future update. But, until then, I can't recommend this tablet for anyone who might easily be confused by this new ""feature"" - and it's a regular annoyance for me, too. It's too bad. Because otherwise, this is a very nice tablet for the price point. I'll circle back and note if this issue gets resolved with a future update.",2,Tab M9
Kindle Customer,12/13/2023,"Overall this is a good deal for the price.The tablet comes with a cheap, soft case.

I tried this one out and it was everything I was hoping for… everything but one major flaw.On the good side it was fast, smooth, great picture quality. It connected fine to all my other devices and it is, in my opinion, the perfect size for a tablet.Unfortunately I did not know that android tablets have started to go the apple route and do not allow you to increase your device storage space. You can mount an SD for extra storage, but not to increase the devices internal storage. This means that you cannot put apps on the SD and with the newer android OS being close to 15gig on it’s own and the files it creates upon starting your storage space is already half gone. That is not sustainable and I’ll be sending it back. It’s very frustrating because aside from that it’s a perfect little tablet for me. Sad day…",3,Tab M9

It is the first tablet that I have encountered that replicates the screen size of my Nook HD+ which had an 8.9 inch screen that was truly one of the best I have encountered. This Lenovo Tab M9 has finally offered me at bare minimum an equivalent of the HD+ with a much more advanced hardware and software system and noticeably lighter! No issue adding my e-book reader app of choice (eReader Prestigio) and also the Kindle app. Could not be more pleased with its performance, ease of use, and dependability. Would like to have seen longer battery life but with Wi-Fi off and in Airplane mode, it is sufficient. As for any/all of its other tablet uses, I cannot comment.

I have a Samsung phone with Android 13 which still shows the pull down menu, so it appears to be this tablet and not Android 13.  Also, the tablet comes with 16 GB of system files, so if you bought the 32 GB tablet it might not leave you with enough memory for your needs.

Jack G.,1/29/2024,"I'm replacing another (older) Lenovo tablet with this one after breaking the screen on the other. I was very happy with that tablet, so I thought this would be a safe choice. Definitely a mistake.The tablet has an infuriating problem with breaking browser windows by reloading them if I switch away to another app and come back. This causes lots of problems if you have entered information previously or are using a progressive web app. There's not enough memory on the device to handle keeping inactive apps in memory. Normally that's an uncommon thing, but with this tablet it happens every time I'm browsing. Makes doing any kind of forms submission just about impossible unless you never leave the window. That dropped my rating from 4 stars to 2. (The other lost star was battery life}.The form factor is nice, the 9 inch screen is definitely a good size for reading books. The battery life isn't great, I end up charging it daily to be sure I have enough power for the next day. And there is an annoying Lenovo ""Duraspeed app restrict"" application which appears to be a watchdog to slow or lock background apps down if they use too much processor. Again, this feels like a kludge because the tablet is underpowered.Bottom line: at this price you can do better. It's not worth the headache.",2,Tab M9

Aly K|Aly K,11/21/2024,"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old and let me tell you why and how I came to this one:My husband gave my toddler his old Android Galaxy tablet a year ago and it has since died. It was a very old tablet but did what we needed it to do. When it died, I found an Amazon fire kids tablet, which was not what I expected at all and though there being lots of things for kids, there was very little parental control I actually had and we could not download the apps we wanted as it's all through Amazon.I then ordered an android kids tablet and I had it set to return within a few hours of opening it because of similar issues. We could download the apps we wanted but they were different- youtube kids for example. It did not allow us the option to log in to the account we already had and would not allow us the option to show only approved content. It was preloaded with ""teacher approved"" content for the age range. It had complete brain cells killing trash on it. I would block one channel and 5 more would pop up. The layout and format of the android kids tablet was also very different from the regular android tablets as well.It was at this point that I landed on this Galaxy Samsung tablet and I am SO happy with this purchase! It is everything we need and were looking for! The size is perfect, the picture quality is great, set up was a breeze, it connected to wifi and Bluetooth headphones easily and quickly and the sound is great too! It has a fast speed and it all works great. It doesn't get hot and it doesn't ever freeze! The price is super reasonable too, especially for what you are getting.Bonus to this tablet and what makes it great for my son is that I can hide all the apps and basically everything on the tablet that I don't want my son messing with. I can make it to where the ONLY things he can get into or have access to are the hand selected apps of my choosing. I was able to log into kids youtube and log in with the same login we have on our TV and other devices so that saved time and allowed for my son to only see the content that I approved for him to watch. I was able to download a bunch of the completely free and add free learning apps (lucas and friends) and he can have the fun of screen time all while it being all learning- ABCs, numbers, learning how to spell, how to write, easy math, puzzles, etc.I wish I could go back in time and start with this tablet instead of wasting my time with the other two I tried out.  If anything happens to this one, I will definitely be buying again and recommending this tablet to my SIL for my nephew.  I can also use this for myself as well.I bought the following kid proof case and it fits this tablet like a glove and will help protect it from my 4 year old dropping it.  It has the front screen protector on it as well which will help shield the tablet from getting wet too if spilled on.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLYCJZTH?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Efi,1/20/2025,This is a great tablet and the price is great thin fast and looks cool it replaced my old Samsung tablet and this is way faster and better its so light when I hold it and love the amount of storage space it has,5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Christine Martin,1/16/2025,"This tablet has replaced a laptop computer and does everything I used to use the laptop for.  I use it to run music software connected via midi cable to a digital piano.  I also browse the internet, create simple documents, print and read digital books.  The screen is large enough that I can see easily.  Honestly, I probably barely use 10% of its actual capacity.  I'm going to put a pop socket on it or some other 'handle' so I can easily hold it as I opted not to buy the case - I just didn't want the bulk.  It is small, light weight, and powerful.  Very pleased.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Godsdaughter54,12/24/2024,"It's nice. A bit disappointed.  Read all reviews as I always do before buying an item. Here is my review as a 70 year old that does know technology.  No product is perfect. I have had many tablets over the yrs. This one is an upgrade. I did have an Amazon Fire before. That one was showing it's age but after a few hrs still had incredible battery life.Now to this one. Honestly if I did not have everything loaded on it, I'd send it back. No battery life. It's awful. It does not have proper charging so I use my quick charge that I use for my android phone. But it takes forever to charge. It's slim. Nice screen. Other then the battery life it appears to be OK. Only had it 2 weeks. So let's see. I will be back to continue this review in a few months of use.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
Alicia Gandy,12/24/2024,"My expectations have been greatly exceeded by the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+. The 11-inch display is truly impressive, featuring stunning vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and perfect for streaming movies, browsing the web, or working on documents. The tablet's slim design enables effortless portability, while maintaining a durable and premium feel. Performance is characterized by smooth execution, courtesy of the robust processor, which facilitates rapid app launching and seamless multitasking. Battery life is exceptional, allowing for all-day usage on a single charge, even with heavy use. Additionally, the sound quality is outstanding, with speakers delivering clear and rich audio that enhances the overall experience. Given its price, this tablet offers incredible value, making it an ideal choice for students, professionals, or anyone seeking a reliable and affordable Android tablet. Highly recommended!",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
VVBulldog,10/23/2024,"I had a 9 inch before but it was slow and laggy. I decided to get a better one and found this. I was not sure if the screen would be too large for me. What I found is I personally love it. It is absolutely awesome for both on road and off road navigation. I loved being able to see way down my route and it was nice and fast so finding the next gas or food stop to add to my route was a breeze. I also really like that you can split the screen three ways and when doing so all my apps worked well.I do not like in dash screen headunits so I purposely bought an old style with buttons and knobs. So for me I was able to place the tablet low where it blocks most of the headunit so it does not block my view at all of the road. I stream exclusively so really all I need is my steering wheel controls. The 11 inch screen is big though and many, if not most, will probably not like it as much as I do. For me it was a dream.I do have a data plan and bought the one for my service. I have not had any issues. The sim card went right in and was working, giving me 5G service. I do always download offline maps for my trips and on my last one that took me way out and without service the GPS of the tablet was great and never once did it not know where we were. Made the trip a breeze.Personally, I prefer using a tablet like this instead of a in dash screen for a few reasons. First, I can take it with me. I can take if from vehicle to vehicle and then take it inside my tent, hotel room, house, etc. So, I have everything right there in one place. That brings me to my second reason of planning. I can have it with me anywhere and plan my route and trips right there. So if we stop to eat and I want to change some things and or check some things out I can easy and without having to sync anything or sitting in my vehicle. Third, I love that I can have it facing me. I hate how a in dash screen points straight back and prefer to have it facing me for the best view. This just works for me and I prefer it. I do use the tablet for other things like cruising the web, and it does that well too. My last one I mainly only used for nav and kept the app count low to try and keep it as quick as possible. That has not been an issue with this one and now watching a movie or show is much better on the much larger screen.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Arkveveen,1/22/2025,"Let me tell you a short story first. I'm 37 years old now, but back in 2016 I got a Galaxy Tab E for Christmas. I've been using that same tablet for years now. It's been reliable and continues to function, but it has awful performance, and apps are starting to freeze or crash. It's only gotten worse over time. It only had 12GB of space and 1GB of RAM. It's a shame, but it was time to put it to rest after a dutiful amount of use. I want to play mobile games, and it just wasn't cutting it. I also like to read books on Kindle, and my books were taking 4GB of the meager space on that old tablet. That poor tablet is now getting its much deserved permanent rest.Now fast forward to 2025. I just got this new tablet because of its excellent value. And I'm ASTOUNDED by it! It's surprising how much power you are getting here, along with the large bright screen. It can run 2D or 3D games really well, much better than you'd expect, but it depends on the game. 2D games are smooth as silk, such as my current favorite Dragon City. As for 3D games, Raid: Shadow Legends absolutely runs amazing even on ultra settings, and it's quite shocking to behold for such a cheap device, but that game isn't exactly the pinnacle of mobile graphics anymore, is it? Don't expect to run Zenless Zone Zero or other more visually intensive games which I play on my PC instead.The game performance for most games alone makes this tablet a surprising value. Yet it also has good battery life, charges quickly with most modern chargers, and has a stable operating system. I don't know if I'm just too used to using bad mobile devices, being mostly a PC gamer with a powerful gaming PC, but you really can't go wrong with the A9+ as a portable computer option!",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Amazon Customer,12/21/2024,great tablet for the price. aside from battery issues the tablet is great to use . sound is good and and the screen is very good. Easy to navigate and uninstall apps you don't want. Highly recommeded.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
Mckenzie Tucker,1/20/2025,"I ordered this to use for school. it works great, has a lot of space, the camera kinda sucks compared to a phone camera but I mostly just use it for note-taking.  I would recommend for school also getting a pen and keyboard because it helps alot but as far as if you just want to game this works great. I use it everyday. it does take a bit to charge. like hours but it does have a great screen life when it is charged. I use mine for school, games, and watching movies and it still works great even since I got it in August 2024 and it is now January 2025 so not too long but still works great.  will update of any issues arise",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
TomRK,12/23/2024,"I really like this tablet. Everything works well. It is everything it is advertised to be. There are just two unadvertised things that cause me to give it 4 stars......Very nice. Very well made. Nice feel. I like it. But it is heavy. It is not possible for me to hold this tablet with a cover in my hands for long. I must lay them in my lap and get new glasses for that distance. But I am 81 so this might not be a problem for a younger stronger person. However, I would still give it 5 stars with this problem.The big problem is that the screen size is 11 inches. Microsoft does not allow its Android Office Suite to run for free on a tablet larger than 10.1 inches. They want $7 per month. Not going to happen. If I had known this I would have bought a 10 inch tablet. I cannot find a workaround. The only real options are to use Google Docs if you trust being online with Google, or WPS Office a free open source program. Just don't be fooled into subscribing to the paid pro version when you first open WPS. The only problem here is that when you first install it, it doesn't have the fonts you want and it tries to get you to pay for more font. Don't do it.  It is very easy to add True Type Fonts to the Fonts folder in Android 14.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
Erik L,1/6/2025,"I bought this on a fairly tight budget to replace my fried 9th gen ipad. (Don't be like me and buy a cheap knockoff Chinese brand charging block!)First the pluses:- Great bang for the buck. For $199 you get a good, not great, fairly vibrant 11 inch screen, 128 gb memory, and importantly, 8 gb RAM.- It's thin, sleek and in my opinion, looks good.- Speakers are surprisingly loud- It has a headphone jack! Love that I can use my full sized Sennheiser wired headphones. One of my reasons for not going with the 10th gen iPad - no headphone jack.- Setup is a breeze with Samsung smart switch, was painlessly able to transfer what I wanted over from my phone.No cons, so far, but rather trade offs for getting an 11 inch Samsung tablet at this price:- Battery life is very average- it's only a 5000Mah battery and it shows - nowhere close to the battery life of my 9th gen iPad.- No fast charging - using an Anker Prime charger with a quality high speed cable, I could only get 10 watt charging.- Cameras are mediocre at best. If you're buying this for the cameras, don't.Overall, very happy so far. Will update if I run into any issues. Feel free to ask any questions.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Amazon Customer,1/19/2025,"I bought this for my self to use as a media device when I'm out and about and I'll say that it does the job well for me. I primarily watch Netflix and YouTube and this does the job for me. Screen feels great, tablet feels good in the hand and the speakers are nice when pairs with dobly atmos. You get the nice over saturated Samsung colors but it works. In terms of a gaming device, I wouldn't recommend for that personally. I played public, cod mobile and TFT and man the graphic and performance in those games were pretty bad. If gaming is your niche, I'd spring for a more flagship tablet if you had the budget.  Overall a good tablet for media consumption.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
Tiktoktacoguy,1/9/2025,"It was perfect, I tried to find one in a store to try out, but I couldn't... so I was a little nervous if it would fit my needs. I primarily use a small laptop for trips and travel but this is WAY better. Very fast, everything connected up perfectly. The initial setup walkthrough was flawless and I had my laptop replacement in under 10 minutes. The screen is bright and crisp. It quickly goes through my apps, I can split screen between emails and messaging platforms, and it's super convenient that I can just charge it off of any USB C connection. I paired it with a little portable carrying case and wireless keyboard and it's everything I need!",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Wile E.,12/24/2024,"Setup was a huge headache.  Partly because I only got the 64gb version (plus 256GB microSD).  I did the samsung smart switch with my phone which got my apps and stuff over.  But then had to move a bunch of the apps from the internal storage to SD card.  After everything it is ok.  It is kind of slow...but I guess that is to be expected of a $150 tablet (faster definitely isn't worth the $800 extra for S10 tablet).Overall:  Pretty ok for the price, but I would advise to get the 128GB version.Update:  I just realized that the 128GB doesn't only have an extra 64GB of storage, the RAM goes from 4GB to 8GB which would help it a lot in responsiveness.  Had I realized the RAM difference, I would definitely have gone that route.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+

L.P.,12/13/2024,BE AWARE that the wall/ outlet charging adapter is not included with the tablet.  Only the USB C to USB C charging cord is included.  I am very disappointed that after receiving the Samsung A9+ tablet I realized that I had no way to charge it.  I don't own any Samsung products or other electrical components that require a USB C to USB C charger therefor I had to purchase the charger separately after the tablet was delivered.  Nowhere in the description on the Amazon or Samsung websites does it explain that you do not get the wall charger/ adapter with the tablet.  Amazon and Samsung need to make it very clear that you will not get the charger with this product ( probably other products also ).  Other than that I am very pleased with this tablet and it does everything that I need it to.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
Ape tastic!,12/6/2024,"I bought this during Black Friday deal so everyone knows.It comes pretty awesomely equipped however during the setup I was not able to skip the Google sign in which was rather annoying but I just logged in and all was good after that. I have had 0 issues with it, and I honestly I was extremely hesitant after reading somethings online about this device. However I did get it and its so far pretty great the preloads weren't completely over the top also which is nice. I have had 0 issues maintaining connection to wifi within my 1,625 sqft home and garage I do not have any as stated above. I use it for; streaming movies legally, browsing online, listening to music, connecting to my ring camera application, and journal voice memos which is why I am looking to get a quality keyboard case for it.**I will say you need to get a case specifically for this device do not buy anything that doesn't say Galaxy A9+ otherwise it will not fit more than likely I imagine is the same for keyboard heads up.**",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

I plugged it in at 1% then worked a 8 hour shift and it only got to 60%. You also definitely cannot use it while it’s charging because it will die.

dana floyd,1/4/2025,For 150.00 you would be hard pressed to beat it. I use it for entertainment and streaming and it's great. Runs YouTube TV and all the streaming apps. I'm really impressed with the speakers. Not your typical bargain tablet. If you are on the fence this is a good choice. Now it's not going to be comparable to the more expensive tablets. If you want to spend $500 or $600. But this is $150 and it's a really nice little tablet I'm totally satisfied.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
White Rabbit,11/13/2024,"I've had several Samsung phone devices including more than a few of the Galaxy S lineup, and I'm a big fan of them. I needed a tablet I could sit in a stand for use as a portable/battery-powered extra TV for steaming YouTubeTV in the kitchen and out on the deck, and this really fits the bill. I intentionally got the model with the minimum specs (no need for terabytes of storage when used as a streaming TV), and it works perfectly fine for how I'm using it. And, honestly, the very limited way I'm using it essentially ignores all of the bells and whistles a Galaxy tablet comes with even in that baseline format. The Android platform is very familiar, and it and my phone devices can sync stuff (like display notifications of my text messages if I so choose), so that's a nice bonus. The sound quality is great, and I'm totally happy with the resolution. If there's any negative, it might be battery life. I'm only using it as a streaming TV, so who knows whether this application uses more battery that way or not. But even when I have it set with all the right battery saving settings, it does seem to run down the battery % a little faster per session than I'd expected. It could be because the screen brightness is tweaked up for TV viewing. But the recharge time is quick. Anyway, I'm not going to downgrade this product for something like that. It's a very good value IMHO. Mad props to Samsung for their Galaxy product lineup.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Amazon Customer,1/15/2025,"Love my tablet it's a samsung!

This A9+ with 8 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs storage boots up quickly, has good quad speakers and a bright screen with good battery life. As far as apps, many of them can be uninstalled which is good. Companies who sell tablets should not force app advertising on consumers. I see myself using it a lot more than previous tablets.

So far, I'm impressed with this new tablet. The screen size is great, and the speed is more than sufficient for the price. It comes with a USB cable, which I believe is either a mini or micro USB on both ends. It would be more convenient if one end was a USB-A.  That’s my only complaint so far.

It also has a USB cord to transfer files from one device to another.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
Ron in Palm Springs,10/16/2024,"I've been a computer user for many years (not an expert though) and I own a Samsung smart phone and laptop, so I'm not a novice to technology but I am for a tablet. It comes with a lot of bloatware, easily removed, and I was able to easily pair my phone settings to the tablet wirelessly - no problem. Haven't tried using the tablet as a phone yet but I probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside. So far I have enjoyed it, but I am disappointed that Samsung has sooooo many updates that consume a lot of time. I knew there would be a lot of updates when I first turned it on, but several days in I can still expect a Samsung update almost on a daily basis, and this is after I've done all the customizing that I want. Drives me nuts, so I encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to NOT do auto updates or you'll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something!  Do them on command or schedule them!  Samsung - get with it and bundle updates so they are less frequent, albeit more time consuming for each one. Other than that, apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good as are response times when moving from app to app or screen to screen. The battery life has been very good so far, and seems better than my cell phone. One thing I don't understand is why Samsung has offset the search bar on the home screen.....it is off center to the left on the screen no matter how I turn the device. Not a deal breaker but just looks very odd, if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen. The tablet is quite light, very thin, and the 10"" size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me. I especially like the touch keyboard that automatically displays with the Google search bar. Once I get past my learning curve, I'm sure I'll have more to say, but all in all, I'm mostly happy with the purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

Federico F.,1/7/2025,"If you limit the battery charge to up to 80%, it's enough to last for a day on *light* use. It drops from 80 to 60 in less than 2 hours.Also, the animations for moving between pages is not as smooth as should be for 8GB of RAM.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+

Nely Fu,1/8/2025,"Easy to set up and use.  Light and just slightly bigger than the A7. All the apps transfer/copy from phone to tablet.However, I cannot make the phone and text functions work.Don't know why these apps on the tablet cannot link with my phone.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+

MMOSB,11/14/2024,"I am very pleased with this tablet. I use it with the addition of a 128 gig microsd card. Great video quality for the movies and episodes I watch on Prime. I use this for all of my ebooks with several apps (Kindle, Nook, Google Play Books, Libby, Digital Editions, EBSCO Mobile) and it has been a delight. I bought one for my mother who is older and she finds it to be heavy, so, be alert to that.The sound is great through the speaker; I have not tried headphones yet. I use this tablet with a full tablet cover, which I would recommend, especially one with a kickstand. The tablet does not stand up on its own so a kickstand makes it much nicer for viewing videos or reading books.Samsungs are know for carrying a lot of bloatware that you cannot delete, like their own email app or their own browser app, etc. I found that this tablet came with very little bloatware that could not be removed; I am very pleased with that.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Just Jean,12/26/2024,"Samsung Galaxy A9+ does what I need it to do and is fairly easy to figure out. Yes, I am one that grew up with all brothers and I'm used to figuring out how to do stuff.  I don't normally use android, but I wanted an android for 1 game that I play and I just love it.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Chris Marquette,12/31/2024,We use over 90 Android tablets as ELDs in our semi-trucks and have tried many different brands with the Samsung ones being the only ones that last. Cost was important as they seemed to walk off so we had to strike a balance between function and cost of replacement.  My only complaint would be not being able to lock them down even with custom ROMS,5,Galaxy Tab A9+
RAW,1/10/2025,"Crisp and clear display, has worked great for the stuff I have tried. Long battery life, impressed. The 4 speakers give a good immersive sound stage when watching movies or just listening to music.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
Philip Ross Gordon,12/29/2024,"I use a tablet with a bluetooth keyboard when I go to Starbucks and the like. I usually use an Amazon Fire HD 11, but my note-taking program, Evernote, will not work with Amazon products. So, I bought this. Wow. it is fantastic. With the stylus and keyboard, I have a full office. The screen is bright and clear, the processor is very fast, and the unit is tough as nails. Most highly recommended.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

Mike Stover,1/4/2025,This is the first Android device I've owned.  My wife switched to the Samsung/Android phones and tablet some time ago.  So far I like the tablet BUT it is much different interface than my Apple products.  We'll see how the learning curve goes.  Hopefully this will be a good chore AND replace the Kindle reader I have been using.,5,Galaxy Tab A9+

fishing fool,4/24/2024,"I got the 128 model on the Amazon sale a few days ago. The only reason I bought it was for traveling because I did not want to drag around my 2022 IPad Air and possibly lose, or mess up, a 500.00 tablet.So......like the headline states......it's OK for the price. Not the retail price, but the sale price. Last year I bought the Fire 11 for the same reason, travel, but ended up returning it after a few days due to a price drop and Amazon refusing to offer a price match discount. Along those lines...........I tried my best and spoke to numerous people over an 8 month period but Amazon refused to return or credit the 70 or so I received from trading in two cheaper Amazon tablets when I bought the 11. I have been informed, over and over again by Customer Service, you lose the trade-in on a return. Now, I cannot find this ANYWHERE in the trade-in policy. But there it is so be forewarned.I would say both the tablets are very similar, with a slight edge maybe to the Samsung with the 8GB vs 4GB on the Fire. Neither are as smooth as the Air, but that is where the price difference comes in. When I bought this I believe the Fire was 199 and the A9+ was 209. For an additional 4GB of memory 10 bucks is good for me. Plus, I had no more available trade-ins for the 20% discount.As for the tablet itself..... The sound is fine, picture is fine, and I really prefer Google Apps as they just seem to have more of what I want. I imagine build quality is similar. Now for the apps.......Prime video was loaded, along with Peacock, Disney, MGM, HBO/Max, Paramount......all my streaming services with one glaring, if not unexpected, exception. Apple+ TV. I found an ITunes app, but no TV app. Maybe the Fire has it, I don't know.I also loaded Samsung SmartSwitch which allowed me to sync info from my IPhone. No issues, worked well although it did take a minute using wireless connectivity.The tablet did not come with a plug as has been noted many times. I guess, you know, is it a big deal if you have other electronics? No. But if this was your only one.......I mean, really? Is that plug really saving all that much money off the list price? Some of these things the corporations do nowadays just seem silly/greedy.As far as charging goes, this seemed to be another hot topic. So, using an Apple 20W Fast Charger, the tablet went from 13% to 100% in about 2 1/2 hours. If I went USB-C only I would guess more than double that time would be required. I did make sure Fast Charge was on in the tablet.....it shipped that way.The battery did seem to wear down rather quickly, but not fast enough to return the tablet. The phone transfer was about 30 minutes, and all I did other than that was load Apps and change some settings for a few hours. This took me from 50 to 13%. How that compares to my Air, no idea. But it is acceptable.One thing I do not like.....and maybe I just need to try a bit harder.....I cannot figure out how to get Auto Blocker turned on. It's right there in Settings, but greyed out as is two other advanced settings below it. I just keep seeing a spiral up top right like something is trying to load. Only thing I can figure out is if you have free apps loaded you cannot block the pop-ups or whatever.Wi-Fi hooked up right away so I did not bother trying my phones Hot Spot. Other than that, I see no issues with this tablet. At the right price, of course!",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
JDWAlexander,1/3/2025,"I bought it as an Xmas gift for my kid, replacing his A7 that was not really keeping up with him.

Ryan W,9/15/2024,"I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ Tablet, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its sleek design and the quality of its build. The 11-inch screen is a perfect size, offering a large enough display for all my needs without being cumbersome to carry around. The screen resolution is stunning, providing crisp and clear visuals that make watching videos, browsing the web, and reading e-books a pleasure.One of the standout features of this tablet is its quad speakers. The sound quality is phenomenal, with rich, deep bass and clear highs that make listening to music and watching movies an immersive experience. Whether I’m using it for entertainment or for video calls, the audio performance is top-notch. The speakers are strategically placed to ensure that the sound is evenly distributed, no matter how I hold the tablet.The performance of the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ is equally impressive. With 64GB of storage, I have plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and files. The tablet runs smoothly and efficiently, thanks to its powerful processor and ample RAM. Multitasking is a breeze, and I haven’t experienced any lag or slowdowns, even when running multiple apps simultaneously. The battery life is also excellent, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use.Another feature I appreciate is the user-friendly interface of the Android operating system. It’s intuitive and easy to navigate, with plenty of customization options to tailor the tablet to my preferences. The pre-installed apps are useful, and there are countless additional apps available for download from the Google Play Store. The tablet also supports a variety of accessories, such as keyboards and styluses, which enhance its functionality even further.In terms of connectivity, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ has everything I need. It connects seamlessly to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, and the signal strength is consistently strong. The tablet also has a USB-C port for fast charging and data transfer, which is incredibly convenient. The camera quality is decent for a tablet, allowing me to take clear photos and videos when needed.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ Tablet. It offers a perfect blend of performance, design, and functionality, making it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable and versatile tablet. Whether you’re using it for work, entertainment, or staying connected with loved ones, this tablet delivers on all fronts. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality Android tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

Lorecus Jamerson,11/20/2024,"It's a good buy for the price, should've waited until blackfriday week to purchase but what the heck it's still worth the price.. I don't know why all the bad reviews but this tablet is simply beautiful.  Does what it says, and no the setup doesn't take that long but to sync your phone takes maybe 15 min, but the performance is ok, it lags a little when you keep adding more apps to it, durable, screen quality is 1080p, from what I see... overall, not a bad purchase, I just watch movies and Netflix on it and it's wifi and hotspot capable. I'm in the oilfield and it works fine with my hotspot.. works amazing on wifi at home.. again, I would buy another one, just with more gbytes though...",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
