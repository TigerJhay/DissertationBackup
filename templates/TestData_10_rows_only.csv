Phillip R Steigleder,7/29/2022,The phone and price are great.  Only set back is the phone claims to be unlocked.  Would not work with my carrier (Pure Talk) .  Had to leave them and go with T mobile.  So far so good.,4
Ken Ficklin,9/12/2022,"Everything I read affirmed this phone to be one of the best dual sim phones on the market. When I received the phone it only had a single sim tray. I returned the phone and am waiting the refund. I then went down to Best Buy and bought the phone after verifying the dual sim tray. The down side is that I needed to down load an app for everything to work. An app for the dual sim, connecting with my computer, playing music etc. It should have had these from the factory. I like the phone and it has better reception than my last phone. Only had it for a couple weeks, still learning.",1

victor,12/2/2022,Was using iPhone 12 before this and was expecting several more hours of usage but utterly disappointed. Even with 60hz I was getting the same usage hours. But it feels nice,4
John and Dorothy Conner,12/12/2022,This has come to me with not physical defects just like buying one from the factory. No problem turn it on and transfering all my data from my old phone and this at a great price.,5
