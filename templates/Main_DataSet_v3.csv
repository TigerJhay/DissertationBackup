Ryan S.|Ryan S.,8/10/2024,"Hello, this is my first review on Amazon. This review comes courtesy of a longtime Samsung user. Included is a picture of my S9 FE+ 256GB next to my second S6 Tab Lite (I lost the first one ;( ) shot on a S20 FE 5G. I will be comparing to my S6 Tab Lite. I really like the S6 Lite. I got it for $200 at Walmart (for both S6's). For comparison, I was given a Nexus 7 back in 2012, which was also purchased for $200. The Nexus is now 12 yo, and barely works. Using the S6 has been awesome. It's only chugged during intensive moments in gaming, and it only froze for a second or two. With three times the RAM as the S6, I don't think I'll have any problems for a long time.nThe size of the S6 Tab Lite is a lot more manageable for me. I could use it (the S6) one handed if I was only really using one half of the screen. I definitely can't with this! That being said, as somebody who's working on an engineering undergrad degree, I found the screen of the S6 too small. This screen feels big enough to use on most days. And with 256 GB instead of 64 GB, I can have games and lots of notes.A few notes: the S9 pen is a bit thicker and has a smaller button than the S6 pen. Second, I was getting better rear photos on the S6 than the S9, I don't know why. I hope it's user error. I'll update you on that. Finally, the S6 feels slimmer in my hand even though they're the same thickness, thanks to the S6 having rounded corners versus the sharper/more upright edges on the S9.Conclusion: For relaxation, the S6 is better, assuming you're not playing hard-core games (it ran fine on Honkai ... on the lowest settings). For work, the extra real estate pays dividends and with a good keyboard case, should be good to replace the laptop most of the time.Proper Review:When I wrote this originally, I didn't have the Samsung portfolio case. I left a review there about a month ago. (Short and sweet: It's very expensive, but it's also perfectly suited to what I need from this device. Backlighting would be nice, but I don't find it to be as much of an issue as I did a month ago.) Update on the camera: I think I smudged up the camera when grabbing the first time. I took a picture of an outdoor scene, and although it wasn't sharp, it wasn't really fuzzy either. I haven't done a side-by-side comparrison with the S6 Lite though. I'll update this update if I determine that smudges weren't the cause of the picture quality deficit.I learned about more software features, like RAM+ and wireless mirroring. In options, it gives the ability for up to 8 GB of virtual RAM. However, I also noted that 4 GB of RAM+ was selected and turned on by default. When I turned it off, it still showed up as 12 GB. Hopefully, this means I can have 20 GB of RAM, although I can't possibly imagine I'd need that many. I've noticed that the tablet seems to use at minimum around 4-5 GB of RAM. Makes me wonder how the S6 Lite manages to run Honkai Star Rail. I've seemed to have more performance issues in games than the S6 on higher settings, but the battery life is much better. It feels like this will never die! The S6 could only do 3-4 hours of gaming, but this can do much more, I think atleast twice as much, maybe triple? This also has faster charging speeds. Let me demonstrate the battery life. I have 1hr 15 minute classes. With note-taking almost the entire time, this went down 7%. At that rate, that's probably almost 16 hours of on-screen time!This tablet really is something special, especially with the portfolio case. It's small enough that I feel comfortable walking a mile to class with this in my hands (in a 13' Macbook case lol), and it's big enough that I can get work done on it - as long as I'm not constantly switching tabs. Windows is better for rearranging tabs, although Samsung provides more freedom - I just don't find that freedom useful personally. I still stand by my opinion that gaming is easier on the smaller screen - I accidentally pressed the accelerator in RR3 numerous times on the S9 FE+, but that never happened on the S6 Lite.Anyways, that's it for me. I'd highly recommend getting the extra RAM, especially if you're like me who was raised to use stuff until it falls apart. If you're a student, I couldn't recommend this tablet more strongly.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
4 Lil Lambs,11/1/2024,"I absolutely love this brand's tablets. This is my second one. But probably the fourth tablet for my family to purchase. First one lasted almost three and a half years before I had trouble with it. Then another five before it gave up the ghost.I love the upgrade of the pen. This was my one big reason with go with another samsung over say a fire. And I was thrilled with how well this tablet handled my artwork.Since getting I've been on it a lot. I love the bigger screen (In comparison to my phone) The high speed under which it works.If I could change or improve this, I don't think I would. The pen was my main complaint in the past, but I am thrilled on how they included, and upgraded it and how smoothly it works.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Stephen the Ex-Monk,12/20/2024,"Like any mobile device from Samsung, this tablet is well built and will last a few years if not abused.I'm not over fond of the Samsung special apps loaded and I tend to squash any I can. This is one reason I wish I could get a Pixel tablet with the same features, I do not like bloat.Aside from the unneeded software, it's pleasing to use. Some things are different from my old Tab S-3, but it's quite a few years newer so that's expected.Of note, the included S-pen will magnetically attach to the back of your tablet. This is a nice feature but also I don't trust it to keep my pen in place. I purchased a case which takes advantage of the magnet but uses an elastic strap to ensure it stays where its supposed to be.The fingerprint reader is on the power button and I've found it both natural to use and accurate. You can adjust the navigation controls to be either a three button configuration or a gesture type. I prefer the three button. Unlike the S3, these buttons are not a part of the physical devie and instead are onscreen. This gives you the ability to both change the position of the buttons (mine are right of center) you can also change the order so the back button is on the left like most other Android devices. Oddly, I am so used to having my tablet with back button on the right instead of left that I just left it there.When I activated the mobile connection, Verizon downloaded an e-sim to it instead of using the included nano-sim. It also didn't activate immediately and I don't know why. Eventually I successfully activated it and conclude the range is just as good as my phone. I'm not 100% sure buying with the 5G mobile connection was wise, but that's a personal decision.Outside of the question of whether getting 5G was a good idea, there's no question this is a good product and worth buying.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Farren Farret,12/8/2024,If you are debating getting this tablet i suggest you dong and just get it! the battery life is so good it last up to two days. I use my tablet for college and for illustrations and it works like heaven. On top of this the features are so cool like veing able to use it as a computer or being able to use it as a second monitor. This feature definetly has been helpful as i work on my laptop and need noted open on the side. it’s also decently customizable bc you can change the pen cursor as you’d like. This definetly more worth it than an Ipad in comparison because you’re not spending another $100 for a pen.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
3N?°,7/23/2024,"I bought this to make art and as soon as I touched the top of the S Pen to the screen I was blown away by how smooth and soft the feel is against the screen. Set up was quick and easy. It's even easier if you already have Google and Samsung accounts.It doesn't come with a charger block, only a type c to type c wire, which left me with no choice but to use a random off brand type c charger with a Samsung type A block which I hope won't mess with the battery or life span of this thing.The metallic lavender color is gorgeous and warm, quite similar to the pink HP Stream 14. The S Pen is a pastel, chalky lavender in a cooler tone.This tablet is razor thin, relatively lightweight for its size (perfect for drawing) and has a fantastic display.The user interface is typical of samsungs and androids. Unfortunately, Samsung phone themes are not compatible but you can customize the icons by selecting color schemes that match your wallpaper.Sounds quality is pretty good. It doesn't get too loud. To start, I played a mobile game and watched YouTube. Both experiences were hiccup-free and great on such a large, clear screen.The tablet comes with PENUP already on it, so artists who are just getting back into digital drawing will enjoy the app and its new, intuitive user interface.The S-pen has handwrite to text features that kick in automatically upon pairing with either your tablet or Samsung phone. I tried this S pen with both and the features come built into the pen!",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Mike Richart,12/10/2024,"Buying a new tablet is always hard. So many compromises to make since price is always an issue. I'm glad I picked the Tab 9 fe.Great color and faster than my older Tab.  This is my 4th Galaxy tablet, so I'm pretty comfortable in the Samsung universe. Even so, it takes a minute to learn the new features.Transferring from my old device was easy. Samsung walks you right through it.  A really Big Plus for me is the ability to mount a micro SD card. I added 256 gig. Gives me room.Charging is fast. Samsung doesn't include a wall wart, but I guess we all have a bunch. USB-C cable is Included.The S-Pen is new to me. The pen included is the 'dumb version so some advancedfeatures are not available.  An upgrade is available for purchase, if you want it.I'm not a Power User and this tablet is great for me.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Amazon Customer,11/9/2024,"I absolutely enjoy my new tablet. Price was high, this said, prior to this one i got the Doogee, and had to immediately returned it back to amazon. So i went for the brand i know is reputable. And I did. It was so easy to set up. The style can do everything: draw, notation, and even highlight. Perfect for what i need it for.  The sound from the speaker are clear, love the wide screen. the images as sharp  love the graphics. I still have to learn how to use some of the apps i downloaded like the song book for my guitar. Now I take my guitar lessons on the road with me or any trips i have and never miss out on reading, or my guitar lessons. I also play games and movies. Perfect tablet for my needs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Mar,1/19/2025,"If you install a photoshop for tablets, you'll get the most with images. Excellent tablet; however, if it is considered to design, try a bigger one to find it more confortable. The camera should be improved, however it's functionality is not to be used as camera. I strongly recommend it. Battery, translation, note taking, audio, video.. all excellent.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Kat W,1/6/2025,"My old Samsung tablet stopped receiving updates in 2019, so I figured it was time for a new one. After so much looking and comparing many brands and sizes, I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2023 in silver.Some of the layout and apps look similar to my old tablet, but many things have improved. The tablet seems fast, and charges fast (I purchased a fast Samsung charger separately). I like the fingerprint-scanning button (when the tablet is not locked). The S pen is responsive, even with a glass screen protector installed. I'm not into taking a lot of pictures, so the camera is fine for me. The sound is fine for me as well. since I just need the basics, nothing fancy, and I'm not a gamer.I got rid of some preinstalled apps, some that I was able to remove; others that I couldn't remove I disabled. I added some of my own apps, and added some music on an SD card. I like the note-taking app that was preinstalled.The Tab S9 is the right size for me to use as an e-book reader. I have a case with a hand strap, so I usually hold my tablet to read or check email. There are many things that can be customized on this tablet, including accessibility features. I'm liking this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
KralosJr|KralosJr,12/23/2024,"I just bought it on black Friday and I couldn't be happier about the purchase, the tablet feels very good, good quality, the Dex help mode is very useful, especially for people who need to have several apps open at once, the excellent multitasking. I haven't tried the battery as much but so far it's according to my needs, I have the 65W Samsung charger and I charge the tablet in 1h 30m, so I have no battery issues.Working with the S Pen is very comfortable, writing with it along, with palm rejection is very useful.I haven't tried it as much in games but having a common use have been very fluid the experience, The processor isn't high-end but so far I've done well in the games I've tried.What I like most is its integration with the Samsung ecosystem, I have an S22+ and passing files between devices is very easy, even to PC through Samsung Flow, the connection is very fast.For the use that the one wanted, which was basically for the University, it is really useful to take notes and work on Word or PowerPoint, even more if you add an inhalable keyboard with trackpad. Plus, it's great for watching media, with a good screen and great speakers.Being able to expand your memory using an SD card is something that is strange about today's phones and allows you to expand storage in a very easy way.I am a loyal Samsung user and I have not been disappointed with this Galaxy Tab S9 FE, if you are thinking of buying it, I recommend it.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Kat in AZ,1/21/2025,"When I ordered this tablet, I was thinking it was pretty much the same size as most tablets my family owns and the one I was replacing, but it was a bit larger screen size. It is pretty close to the same weight as the one I was replacing, but has more memory and it works great. The stylus is so easy to use, and it attaches to the back of the tablet magnetically. I bought a case that has an open area for the stylus, with an elastic band to hold it securely, so I don't have to worry about losing the stylus, I am very pleased with this tablet overall.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Piwai|Piwai,1/12/2025,"The Galaxy S9 FE+ tablet is much bigger than I initially expected, but it’s absolutely stunning. The premium design, paired with how thin and lightweight it feels, makes it a joy to use. It’s worth every penny, offering exceptional performance and the ability to multitask seamlessly, thanks to its split-screen functionality.The S Pen is a standout feature—responsive, precise, and perfect for note-taking or creative tasks. The camera quality is impressive for a tablet, and the sound output is nothing short of fantastic, providing an immersive media experience. Overall, this tablet combines beauty, power, and versatility in one sleek package. Highly recommend it!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Akeeli,1/2/2025,"I just wanted a tablet for drawing with, the size is nice enough to where I can see everything and zoom in enough for the finer details.The pen is super responsive and ready to use right of the bat, no charging needed :)I did end up downloading a game or two on it just to see it’s performance and it wasn’t that good lolHonkai Star Rail, and Wuthering Waves are more demanding games than some, and while they do run, they’re crunchy !It runs Puzzle and Dragons, Clash of Clans, and Fire Emblem Heroes well enough at least— but yeah, I moreso got this tablet for drawing !",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Lyn Osborn,1/12/2025,"So far the notebook works fine.  It was in a very filmsy container that was torn open, so hoping I don't have problems down the road. The USPS shipping trail was almost laughable: It started it's journey near Cleveland, OH went to Detroit, MI, up toTraverse City ,MI, down to our town in northern IN to be delivered. BUT NO! Back up to Traverse City, then to Grand Rapids, then to Indianapolis to Fort Wayne, then finally back up to me in northern IN. I had a great time tracking this package. ??",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
LAZYMOODZ,1/7/2025,"I've had my tablet for about 2 months now. I use it for reading and light surfing. Battery life is great because I use every feature possible to save it,  i.e. Battery life saver on, dim display, dark mode, sleep mode, do not disturb mode etc. I can't say what it's like for a heavy user but if you want a ""small screen tablet"" for reading and simple tasks, this is a good choice.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
James S.|James S.,12/7/2024,"This purchase was for my wife for Christmas. She has previously owned two Samsung Tab As. This was a tremendous upgrade for her. She says that the operating system in almost identical to her S24 phone. My first complaint is that Samsung did not include a charging block with this device. Many of the charging blocks available on Amazon have less than stellar reviews. The buyer is left to their own devices to find the most appropriate charging block online or in a retail store. This is sad considering how many iterations of charging blocks manufacturers have gone through in the past 5 to 10 years. Another complaint is that the tab (and separately ordered accessories) arrived in a box with no cushioning material, literally clanging around but this is an Amazon problem and has nothing to do with the quality of the device.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Keith A. Smith,1/15/2025,"I have many Samsung products. TVs, phones, tablets and this s9 FE + makes the eleventh currently in use.With 12gb ram, great processor, and 256gb expandable hd, this is a bargain. Very pleased with the purchase.

Plumer Lovelace,1/12/2025,"The shipment of my Samsung tablet arrived quickly. The device arrived new, and in the manufacturer’s packaging with all of the proper accessories.

I would highly recommend this seller.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
S.D.,12/24/2024,"I used a Samsung S4 before upgrading to this one. I have had a great experience with all of my Samsung devices thus far so I was confident in buying this one. The S4 worked great for as long as I had it. The only reason I switched to this one is because I needed a bigger screen. So far, I'm loving it. The screen size is great. It is fast and has good battery life. I'm hoping to get at least as much use out of it as the previous one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Mountain Biker,12/13/2024,"So far I love this tablet.  The 12.4"" screen size and display clarity exceeded my expectations, and the processor speed is great too!  It was very easy to import all of my items from my old Samsung tablet, so I was up and running again in no time.  Also, the sound quality blew me away, especially considering that it's coming from a tablet.  I wish it came with a case, and it would be great if it had a USB port, but those shortcomings aren't enough to keep me from being very happy with my purchase.  I would highly recommend this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

Gregory L Young,12/14/2024,"Power, power and then some more power. I never want to have buyers remorse when purchasing electronic units such as a tablet or a laptop. I don't want to repurchase my electronics every couple years to keep up with the new power hungry software programs. This is the top rated tablet on the market. Do your research. I researched for over 12 hours for my next tablet. I will be years before I need to go through that again with this tablet. Con: it needs 4 speakers, rather than the two that it comes with. The it would be perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Natacha Brutus,1/3/2025,This is a great tablet at a great price. Not much else to say. I usually get electronics from stores that specialize in electronics but the protection plans ate so pricey so i went with Amazon this time ad it was delivered in perfect condition.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

Not being top of the line at the time I got it was still perfect.

I'm not a great artist, but I feel like I can make and implement my embroidery designs much easier now.It was very easy to set up and start using.

Veronica Subia,10/24/2024,"I was down the rabbit hole on researching the best tablet or laptop for basic writing . Things that are important to me are storage, processing input, portability , durability, accessory compatibility, and  dual functionality. I've had the tablet for about 3 weeks now and I use it daily. I purchased a magnetic bluetooth keyboard for it and it has been a seemless match. The touch sensitivity is HIGH. I'm still learning how to get used to that. I'm able to have multiple screens open and split the screen to view them at once. This is incredibly important for me and what I bought the tablet for. The battery life is very nice as well. I only charge it every other day and I use it a few hours on a daily basis. Charging isn't the fastest but it holds the charge really well ! All in all, I'd say its a great purchase for simple use .",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

The tablet and smaller items were loose inside the outer packing box.I removed tablet from it's tight paper wrap to find the screen covered in fingerprints.Also, one tiny scratch on the back, about an inch long, otherwise it looks brand new.I suspect it was opened gently, fondled admiringly, then regret-returned, but who knows?It hardly seems worth returning for a new one, but Amazon, my friend, you get a 0/5 on this one.I can't give that kind of oversight a free pass, hence the review.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Josh,12/17/2024,Love it so far. No lag amd easy to write on. I prefer the smooth screen to the paper like screen covers.

Bruce E. Nagel,12/12/2024,I'm glad I ordered this. Samsung is a excellent brand. I haven't discovered how to reduce the screen sensitivity. It seems that anything lightly brushing across the screen produces unintentional results. Don't know if that is correctable. I also don't care for the shutting down process. Very hard for me to accomplish in the dark. Overall though I highly recommend this product.,4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

John Galt 2021,10/16/2023,"Updates will be posted on the top.Update #3 12/07/23My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0  Quick download and install no problems.Update #2 10/30/23I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow.  One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the ""strict power saving"" mode.  i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app.  So, I changed the power saving mode to ""optimizzed' and everything worked fine.Update #1 - 10/19/23.I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger.  It took 50 minutes.  The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.It came a day early.  The packaging was excellent.I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8.  I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9"" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger.  The battery was at 51%.  I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick.  I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8.  The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying.  it went pretty quick.All the apps except two copied.  One for some reason is not compatible with the S9.  The other I was able to install from Google Play.  After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps.  The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8.  At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem.  The extra .4"" in the display over the A8 is nice.  The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.I haven't tried any games since I don't play them.  I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.As far as the OS goes.  It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1.  However, the Android security update was Aug 1st.  I imagine it will update soon enough.  Google Play was June 2023.  It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.That is it for now.  I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.Another excellent product from Samsung.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

MISS PRINGLE,8/24/2024,"For a long time, I was strongly considering purchasing a new laptop computer.  I looked at and pondered over the many choices before finally deciding on choosing a new tablet.  I'm so glad I made that decision!The thing I love most about this tablet is its size!  It's about the same size as a small laptop, but with all the advantages of the Android platform.  I love Android!This tablet is fast, and there is a ton of storage space.  The only negative I have found is the same as on my previous Samsung tablet:  Some keys on the keyboard are ""wonky"" (for lack of a better word).  By this I mean, that when typing on the touchscreen, there are times when the key pressed results in a different letter, or even a number.  The ""T,"" for example, will often result in the number ""5,"" right above it.  I'm sure this is my fault somehow,  but it's irritating, nonetheless.Other than that small, occasional issue, I find this tablet to be a cut above my previous Samsung tablet, which had served me well, also.  But, it was time for an upgrade!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Kihan Kim,12/20/2024,The big screen make the wonderful view,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Diana Cornwell,10/30/2024,"I’m making this review on the S9 tablet even though it was returned.  The tablet works great, the visuals are nice. The reason for the return is that it was too large and cumbersome for the individual who was going to use it.  He needed a smaller tablet to use.  This definitely is a good tablet.  I gave it four stars only because it was too large.  Otherwise it is worth 5 stars.",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
TRCIII,10/2/2024,"When my previous Galaxy tablet with S Pen began failing, I found out they no longer made that size tablet, with the minimum now being 10.9"", and I wasn't sure I was going to like it.I don't.  I LOVE IT!  Crisp display, smarter ""Smart Switch"" and built-in technology to lead you through initial setup than I remember from previous upgrades, made the changeover completely painless. Took a 1 TB memory card without issue.  Sound is better than you'd expect from a tablet this size, certainly superior to my old model.  S Pen feels sturdier (especially the pen tip) than others I've had.All in all, a great addition to the Galaxy family of Tablets with S Pen.A few weeks later:Love my Tab more than ever, every day I use it. Someone asked a question (which I was unable to answer or find again) about OTG adapter use. I put in an adapter and added on a 2 TB external SSD with no issues, was able to effect file transfers, play music off the external drive, with no issues. If you need more than the 1 TB that you can add as internal storage, no worries, theres's always a way to access more storage.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Larry M. Bergelt,11/16/2024,"I am so glad I went ahead and bought this tablet. My last tablet was a Samsung from Verizon. Unfortunately, it and its case have seen better days. I don't need the internal wifi anymore since I am now retired and have little use for it outside of the house. I am glad to have bought the larger screen.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

Joe L|Joe L,7/29/2024,"This tablet is more than enough for my needs.The speed, graphics, crisp and vibrant screen, all make for a wonderful experience. I was originally looking into the ultra, but I couldn't justify the purchase when the only real differences are screen, speaker and ram related, and nothing i'll do with it will really max out the current specs. The speakers sound amazing on this thing. Most tablets just have cheap tinny speakers just to fill the spaces while the Galaxy S line seems to have had a lot of thought put into sound quality. The camera is quite decent as well. Not top of the line, but for a tablet, it takes some pretty clear photos.It charges quite fast as well, and stays charged for a while, even with heavy game play, just like my S23 U. I did about 3 hours of straight play on war universe and it was still around 80% when I shut it down.I did make sure to get an illuminated magnetic keyboard case, and a high speed 512gb Samsung Micro SD card for it. Don't need them, just wanted to get them and got a good deal. The next thing I get will be a bluetooth mouse to complete the laptop feel. lolThis is the best tablet for the money in my eyes.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Anonymous Geek,10/16/2024,"Bought this tablet to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 which wasn't able to be updated any more. The S9 is noticeably faster and the video quality is excellent, seemingly even better than the S6. I use VLC software to play videos and the new tablet shows no lag and no drops/stalls. Transferring my data from the S6 was done using SmartSwitch (highly recommended) and the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with the S9. This was really very fast. Loading new videos to the S9 from my PC was also fast, much faster than for the S6. No issues at all. Highly recommended.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Julian,8/23/2024,"Originally, I bought this Tablet with the intent to use it for gaming. Ultimately, I found that there is so much more you can get out of it than that.Its a very thin, lightweight tablet. The screen is an impressive size that felt larger in my hands than I had expected. I was originally considering going for the Ultra, but the size of the S9+ is more than enough for what I need. I actually feel more comfortable using this tablet without the protective case that I purchased for it when at home. I didn't even bother putting on the protective glass screen I bought for it because I don't see myself abusing this tablet as hard as I abuse my phone.The performance is fantastic. This has no problem playing whatever games you might want to play on it and the refresh rate is superb. As someone who regularly uses a high refresh rate monitor, I can appreciate seeing similar performance on a tablet.What I wasn't expecting when I bought this was how much I could get out of Samsung's Second Screen app. This built in application allows you to wirelessly connect your Samsung tablet to your PC and use it as an additional monitor. As someone who regularly uses a laptop for work, its a game changing asset to have. The integration is seamless; you can even choose to enable the touchscreen so that you could browse through documents like you would with a kindle without having to go through the hassle of doing file transfers.However with performance comes a price. It goes without saying that these tablets are pretty damn expensive. If I had to make a recommendation, I would suggest settling for the S9 which my friend bought and is more than satisfied with. Most of what you are getting out of making the jump to the S9+ or Ultra is a larger screen size. Visit your local electronics store and see which one is right for you.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Dnl,9/6/2024,"In today's tech market, all products are expensive.  The Samsung Tab S9 is an amazing device and out performs all other tablets, imo. I prefer it over the giant iPad I have, and this is the 3rd Samsung Tab I have owned.Setup was simple. Just connect with my phone (S23) and done.Classic black body, tons of memory and storage.  Snappy response and beautiful screen.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

The battery holds up the entire day with moderate use which serves my need. Beautiful color rendition, quick, awesome quad speakers. For a Dex experience, a portable keypad for example, Dexnor or similar is recommended.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
PhillyGirl,2/11/2024,"My previous Samsung Note tablet circa 2014 is very old. Not wanting to purchase a new tablet I reformatted it hopefully to bring it back to life. But its old and not useful for todays apps. About a year or more has passed before looking again at the tablet world.  I rocked a Samsung not 8 phone well past its use and recently upgraded to a S23. I absolutely love the S-pen and S-Note. My new tablet had to be pen capable. Just using a pen is way different than pen features baked into the ecosystem of the device.Enter the S9 tablet family. I played around with the idea of getting by with one from the S8 family because of expense, but I like bells and whistles. I also intend to have this tablet for many years, so OS updating is important.I picked the Samsung S9 plus. Amazon was offering it with 512gb with 13 percent off which was 30 bucks cheaper than the 256gb version. I've played the available built in storage game before.  I'll be using this tablet for a variety of functions so having the larger  space for apps and all of my projects will be nice.Test...First I charge to full capacity before turning it onI then used Samsung's transfer tool and copied my apps from my S23 to the S9 plus tablet. This worked without a hitch.Let those apps updateUpdate the OS under settingsPlay time....Audio-I read that the sound of this tablet was superb so I head to play something from my Amazon collection before heading to YouTube to play some videos. It has rich bass and volume.Video-I played a video from my digital library, Amazon, YouTube and Vudu. Colors were nice and bright so no surprises thereS-pen-Although they were creative with the magnetic back storage, I wished it was like the phone and my old tablet with the S-pen stored inside. The pen itself is pleasantly thicker than anticipated. Samsung made a good move in matching the color of both the pen and tablet. There's a lot of features to learn if you care to. The included S-notes is a beast of a program, but you can also use other programs like OneNote.The only thing with the form of this tablet is it is long horizontally. So when holding that way it seems a bit long. I rather like the more square shape of my old tablet. There's a lot to learn about the features and youtube is a great tutor. Even just now typing this out one came to me with holding down the Ctrl key. It lights up the letters y, a, z, x, c and v which are shortcuts for specific functions. Very cool!When you get it, pay attention to the return policy and use it to death within that time frame. This is already long so I may update only if I come across an issue that impacts negatively.It is pricey, but it is a premium feature tablet. You can get cheaper with going with lesser specs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Sam,12/30/2024,"Love this tablet, it runs fast and switches smoothly from app to app. The landscape mode is the only thing I don't really like, it will only turn one direction to watch in landscape which is not convenient. I would check to see when the newest one will be released before spending over 1K on a tablet though. You could end up with an older tablet when the newest is coming out in a month or so.Battery life is great, I use it every day & listen to it all night every night. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to transport or travel with. Easily pairs with any Bluetooth keyboard and any other BT devices.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+

Andrew K.,12/28/2024,This is one of the best purchases I have made over the last few years. Served me well for my productivity. Allows me to get work done out of my desk.

Charlotte Emily,10/26/2024,"i got sucked down the rabbit hole of digital planners and stuff from YouTube shorts, and between that and wanting to learn how to digital draw at some point, i ended up getting this on Prime Day for $750 ($794 after tax i think). I 1000% recommend getting it for that price vs the $900+ as that's so much for a previous series with the 10s out now.for that price, it's amazing. i plan to try to keep it going until 2030 just like the new PC i got in June, and if i get that much use out of it, i'll be so happy.dex mode is underrated, and all my stuff BT-connects without issuesyou can also music share with a samsung phone so they can both use the same headphones/earbuds.my friend even made a comment about how he thought it was very nice as someone who's never really gone after serious tablets before. so i take that as a win as well lol",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

ShareBear,8/21/2024,"** 3 Month update ***I’ve set up a reliable Dex ecosystem for my Samsung tablet, Caldigit TS4 to expand the number of ports available, wired mouse and keyboard, and a monitor (HP Omen). With this setup I can run Dex flawlessly (Dex is a built in desktop operating system that comes with Samsung smart phones and tablets)My primary uses for this device are Google workspace (you have to use the chrome browser for all features, the apps are functional, but lack a lot of editing features), web based management systems, and media.The stock speakers are great (comparable to laptop speakers, a little tinny, but generally sound great for the device class)The screen is gorgeous, and as a stand alone tablet you can absolutely use Dex with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard on the fly, managing a couple windows side by side feels comfortable (not too small)Could this replace your laptop? So long as you don’t rely on specific software. Absolutely, this would be great for student or business owners on the go. Not too big to bring with you, but not too small to be unusable.This thing has exceeded my expectation for sure. Same internals as the ultra tab, smaller screen.Perfect for excel, google sheets, word processing, and when paired with mouse and keyboard is effectively functional as an ultra portable laptop.If most of your work is web based or general word processing 10/10 I’d recommend.Haven’t had any issues with lagging, overheating, or battery health.I do recommend adjusting your battery settings to prevent it from charging past 80%, and while it is convenient disabling fast charging will help preserve the battery life in the long run.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
