hola|hola,5/23/2022,"A few micro scratches on the screen (can't see them if you are not looking at them) and a used up battery at cca 91% health for a few months old phone is not as "" works and looks like just as new""",4
Phillip R Steigleder,7/29/2022,The phone and price are great.  Only set back is the phone claims to be unlocked.  Would not work with my carrier (Pure Talk) .  Had to leave them and go with T mobile.  So far so good.,4
Ken Ficklin,9/12/2022,"Everything I read affirmed this phone to be one of the best dual sim phones on the market. When I received the phone it only had a single sim tray. I returned the phone and am waiting the refund. I then went down to Best Buy and bought the phone after verifying the dual sim tray. The down side is that I needed to down load an app for everything to work. An app for the dual sim, connecting with my computer, playing music etc. It should have had these from the factory. I like the phone and it has better reception than my last phone. Only had it for a couple weeks, still learning.",1
JJS,9/29/2022,"Some days the battery does not last a whole day, the rest of the days it's down to 25%. Not impressed.",4

victor,12/2/2022,Was using iPhone 12 before this and was expecting several more hours of usage but utterly disappointed. Even with 60hz I was getting the same usage hours. But it feels nice,4
John and Dorothy Conner,12/12/2022,This has come to me with not physical defects just like buying one from the factory. No problem turn it on and transfering all my data from my old phone and this at a great price.,5
ismael,12/13/2022,Phone size and Camara capacity are disappointing.,2
Keath wilbur,12/21/2022,I was expecting the phone to not be that good but I like it better then the s22. It's performance is great for the price thank you.,5
charles,12/21/2022,"I like the phone, what I’m upset about is the mystery box I ordered around the 1st of November and haven’t heard from it.",5
sushicatlover,12/23/2022,"I took alot of time to research phones and sellers.  We were switching carriers to xfinity.  Naively I thought that an unlocked phone was good to go and of course you can't access an imei number to check in advance.  We were phoneless for about a week.  Thank goodness all we usually get are junk calls.  Down to the xfinity store we go.  This particular brand, we found out later, DOES NOT WORK MOST OF THE TIME even if it is unlocked.  Then starts the arduous process of reordering another model and returning this one and the case I ordered.  I really needed to chat with Amazon but neither my Amazon app nor my computer could point me to customer service.  They just wanted to automate everything.  I needed help.  Anyway, what I learned is that even an unlocked phone often does not work if your carrier is different from what the phone had been used on.  So do you feel lucky?  Too bad the phone looked new.  So another week without a phone.",3
Grizzme,1/2/2023,just about everything,4
L. S.,1/3/2023,"It is an overall great product, received it in the condition it was promised. The phone battery, however, is just not great, not because it's a renewed phone but in general, measures have to be taken for it to last a day ideally.",4
Yuval Peleg|Yuval Peleg,1/7/2023,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone from Amazon and was extremely disappointed with the condition of the phone upon arrival. While the corners of the phone were undamaged, the back of the phone was full of defects. It appears that the phone may have been previously used.I was unable to return the phone due to my need for a functional device, but I am extremely disappointed with the condition of the phone. I have had to purchase a phone case to cover up the defects on the back of the phone.I do not recommend this product to others based on my negative experience. It is unacceptable to receive a defective and previously used phone. I hope that others do not have the same experience that I did.",1
Ivan Gutierrez,1/12/2023,First time buying renewed  cellphone. Can't tell if was pre-owned or not. Looks like a new cellphone to me. Thanks to the seller. For accuracy description. Definitely will buy again renewed tech.,5
MyChaXio,1/14/2023,I bought this phone for my son.  It's a decent phone for the price and practically is brand new.  It works great and there is not problem with the phone.  I was able to get service on the phone and everything is running smoothly.,5
sylvia russell,1/27/2023,"Original review: The charging port on the phone I received is finicky, and it often goes back and forth (i.e. actively charging for a few seconds, then not charging for a few seconds, then back to charging). Although it's finicky, it does charge to 100% and it holds the charge well. The camera is pretty dang good on this too!2 week update: The charging port barely works at all now. I noticed it was a bit weird the first day I got it, and I incorrectly assumed that it wouldn't be much of a problem. But it worsened pretty quickly and it's now at the point where it barely charges at all. It's disappointing because this phone was advertised as being in ""excellent condition"". I've submitted a return request and I'll be ordering a replacement once I receive my refund.",3
Mark Smith,1/27/2023,So far so good.  Phone is very slippery so you'll definitely need to buy a case for it just so you can safely grip the phone.  I bought a refurbished phone for $329.  Overall I'm happy with it.  Hopefully I'll get 7 years out of it like I did my previous phone.  Speaker volume during a phone call is quiet.,4
Madhu|Madhu,1/28/2023,Daily use,4
Jasper Schrader,2/4/2023,"Almost perfect, chose the ""excellent"" option, phone has some scratches on the back and plastic edges look ""used"" with worn or faded colors. Also, cannot change between 3G, LTE or 5G, the option is hidden. Phone has also restarted by itself once, was browsing settings app when screen went black and the phone restarted. Everything was packaged neatly though, survived a trip from USA 2 stops, EU 2 stops, Africa 2 stops and finally ending in Namibia, all within 8 days. Africa took the longest. The included power adapter was a 10w Motorola unit, wasn't happy with that.Everything functions except for the hidden setting & that one random restart. Would've been nice if they included a screen protector & case.Will buy again.",4
Amazon Customer,2/9/2023,Got this phone thought it would be a better phone than the one I have unfortunately it's substandard there's no Jack for the plug headphones in and no SIM card place and the Bluetooth speaker is very low there's no volume up so this phone sucks,1
Paige,2/10/2023,"Product was as promised .. I am very happy with my purchase.  Good quality, like new..  10 out of 10 would order from thus seller again !",5
PJMZ28,2/23/2023,"Good price and for a refurbished model I wouldn't be able to distinguish refrurb from new,  even if I had a brand new phone right next to it.  Cosmetically it's flawless. On a side note, this is NOT a factory unlocked phone. It's a T-Mobile phone but it still works with my Consumer Cellular SIM. Just need to get used to looking at the big red T-Mobile screen every time you reboot your phone. Being an apple user for many years there's a learning curve and some annoyances with the android apps but nothing that would deter me from getting it.",4
kwasi,2/25/2023,"The condition was as advertised, very happy with the purchase",4
Brittny Grayson,2/26/2023,I ordered a good condition phone and it looks BRAND NEW. put my Sim card in and everything has worked perfectly.Thank you Macalegin electronics!!!!,5
Fernando T.|Fernando T.,3/2/2023,"Estimados amigos, compré este producto y cumple con lo dicho. Compré este producto de Deals Always y realmente lo agradezco, también a Amazon. El producto llegó en buenas condiciones con su cable y cubito para cargar.El teléfono llegó como nuevo y 100 % lo recomiendo con este vendedor.|",5
Kirk,3/6/2023,Amazon described the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE  as being dual-sim when I purchased it.  This capability is why I purchased this phone.  The phone I received is single sim so I complained.  The seller tells me it is single sim plus e-sim.  I showed the phone to a Samsung rep who says it has no e-sim and confirmed the phone I received is single sim.,1
Ethan|Ethan,3/10/2023,"As soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell it was a used phone. It had major scuffs on the corner aswell as around the charge port. I bought one that was supposed to be ""excellent condition"" which I thought would be like new. But it's apparent this one belongs in the ""acceptable"" category. Of course a used phone isn't gonna be perfect, but this one isn't exactly excellent condition. I'm going to put a case around it anyway, so those scuffs won't matter to much to meThe screen looks like it was replaced due to it being scratch free and it had a plastic film over it. My main concern is it might lack it's original waterproof capability because of that, unless the restorer used an OEM seal when applying the new screen.Overall, the phone works really well and there is absolutely no problems using it. I think its a great deal for a phone that is still relatively new and has a lot of life left. I like that it came with a charger in the box. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the misleading ""great condition"" factor. It also had lots of software updates to download the first couple days of use.",3
Mona Edwards,3/11/2023,Battery life is poor. I have to charge 2x a day. I know it's a refurbished phone but thought it would have new battery. I don't believe it does. Other than that it's great.,4
TERRENCE MCD,3/16/2023,Phone was in great shape and condition. But couldn't connect to any wifi service or Bluetooth.,4
Elizabeth Greer,3/17/2023,"Bought this phone for my husband since he loves Samsung products and uses it with his Samsung watch 4. I even bought a rugged case with built in screen protector for it and after 5 months cellular service is always interrupted even after resetting of network and phone back to factory settings. Cannot make calls or receive calls or emails. Same way with Wi-Fi. Cell service is with cricket and have no problems with cricket at all. But then it comes up with AT&T on occasions but have no service with ATT. My Wi-Fi is good and no issues with service or modem. Cricket customer service shows everything working on their end and all numbers show current for their protocols. Don’t know what is wrong with it. Told me I should take ir to a cell phone repair store to see what they may can find out but it would cost more to fix than get a new one. So, it looks like I will be purchasing yet another phone for my husband si he can make and receive calls and email. It just sucks that it didn’t last as long as his other phone did, and reason we bought this one is because his screen and lcd screen was cracked and could not be fixed.",1
David,3/20/2023,Good phone. Great camera. Bought it because it was water resistant.  Had trouble with the phone set up for text messages and my Samsung account but now I'm good. Really a pain.  Battery life is adequate. Paid $288 so it is good value.,4
E-Man,3/20/2023,"I did a lot of research for a replacement for my old S8 and teh S21 FE looked like a good choice. It is.The phone was a refurbished one and I have to say it was like new. The battery is a bit off what reviews state a new S21 should be but it is a refurb which was clearly advertised to be ""At least"" 80% of new so it is as described.The worst thing of the S21 compared to the S8 is the camera. The S8 camera is excellent but the S21 is pretty bad (when I've been use to the S8 quality for years). It is actually tempting to get a new screen from my S8 and toss the S21 due to the really obvious poor quality of teh S21 camera. This is a Samsung issue though.The vendor: Accurate description, Excellent product and fast deliverySamsung: Cop on and bring back the S8 camera!",5
Kate,3/23/2023,"I will say right off the bat, this is probably the way I will buy phones from here on out. It is a great deal cheaper, and I am happy with my purchase. I paid $218 for a one-year old flagship phone.I selected an ""excellent"" condition phone. It came with a glass screen protector, which disrupted the AMOLED display, so I removed it, and noticed a couple of larger scratches that were imperceptible with the protector on. This is not quite according to the description, which is partially why I have my review at a 4-star.The only other issue I have had is battery life. I believe that this phone is running at about 80% battery health. I am a *very* heavy user, and so I have to run the phone with battery saver activated to make it through a full day, but that isn't that huge of a deal. Samsung's battery saver is relatively unobtrusive. However, I may opt for a higher quality renewed phone in the future.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and highly recommend this process to others.",4
Chris,3/30/2023,"The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G phone that I received was listed as Excellent...and it surely was!  It truly was in like-new condition with no hints that it had ever been used.  The phone came with a protective plastic file across the back and sides of phone.  As always, I immediately applied a screen protector and Otterbox Commuter case (both sold separately).  Phone shipment was very quick.  I am very happy with my purchase!",5
Darwin|Darwin,4/1/2023,"El Dispositivo En Tema De Pantalla Y Cámaras Venía Muy bien, Pero Tiene 2 Grandes Defectos El Primero es Que Venía Muy Rayado Como Se Puede apreciar en las imágenes el segundo es que no puedo utilizar Mi Tarjeta Sim La Verdad Es Que no tengo idea de por qué el teléfono no reconoce la targeta he comprado dos targetas para probar si era un problema de la targeta y nada no entiendo|",1
Amazon Customer|Amazon Customer,4/7/2023,"excellent condition without any scratches on the screen that is excessively noticeable, it works correctly for the moment I would say that everything is fine",5
Peter Waite,4/8/2023,"Product is good. Scratches on the screen. Other than that it works perfectly. The charger included in the box is not an original Samsung charger and only 10 watts, it gets hot while charging the phone. Other aspects of the phone are as advertised.",4
Subhomoy,4/11/2023,"It has a very good quality camera, thin and light design, and very nice display. The only problem in this phone is battery. You need to charge it twice even if you are a moderate internet consumer.",4
HugoJH,4/12/2023,"El equipo llegó en buenas condiciones (aunque el embalaje me dio temor cuando lo recibi, pues sonaba a que no tenia proteccion, y en efecto solo la caja de la paqueteria y dentro la caja del equipo), solo llegué a notar una muuuy ligera línea en la pantalla y a contraluz. A la primera agarro mi chip de telcel.El equipo parecía ser nuevo, con 2 días de uso va muuuy bien.|",4

Michael,4/17/2023,Everything went smoothly from purchasing on line to shipping to my address.  Also choosing a cell phone carrier on this unlocked cell phone when well.,4
Carlos D.,4/25/2023,"El teléfono llegó como nuevo, en la caja Samsung abierta (poco deteriorada) y con 1 cable de datos.Me sorprendió el estado del teléfono, volveré a comprar renovados de Amazon.En cuanto al funcionamiento del teléfono todo muy bien, ahora toca probarlo, si lo devuelvo será porque el teléfono no me guste pero no por su estado.*ACTUALIZACIÓN* He realizado un test de la batería y se encuentra con un porcentaje de salud del 88%,  la batería no dura mucho pero No es por el estado de la batería, muchos usuarios de este teléfono (nuevos y renovados) reportan qué la batería no dura mucho y que hay proceso de 2 semanas para que la ia del teléfono mejore el rendimiento, voy a probar y tendré que valorar si devolverlo o quedármelo.Pero la compra como renovado es excelente.Después de varias cargas el estado de salud de la batería ha subido al 94%|",5
Brittany Carroll,5/9/2023,Bought this phone as a birthday gift for my son. When it came I went to have it hooked up to our cell phone company only to find out that the phone is NOT unlocked. Very disappointing! Now I’m going through all kinds of loops to try to get it unlocked. They should not advertise it as Unlocked when it is not!,2
Mario Antonio,5/9/2023,Good to have,4
Luciano C.|Luciano C.,5/9/2023,"El teléfono me llegó nuevo diría, no tiene marcas ni golpes ni defectos de ningún tipo.

Producto recomendado y el vendedor también.|",5
Lourdes,5/16/2023,"Aunque tuve un inconveniente con el tema de la liberación el vendedor pudo solucionarme facilitándome el código necesario y funciona perfectamente desde Venezuela, muy satisfecho|",4
Emily,5/17/2023,Like the phone was in great shape when arrived. Only thing is it doesn't come with a voicemail app. Phone doesn't tell you that you have a voicemail either.,4
Maseko Manyise,5/20/2023,"The things that are not good about this phone.~. Battery drains too fast~the phone heats up during use~its not the super phone I expected, not as fast and smooth.~i have resorted to my Google Pixels 4XL, it gives me better of everything I need.",2
Baldman,5/22/2023,"I did not like the fact that not one piece of paper was sent to show me how to set the phone up. I'm 82 years old and if my next door neighbor hadn't had the same model phone I would have been out of luck as I was also sent the wrong charger and my battery was at 12 per cent. After getting charged from my neighbor, I took the phone to my A.T.& T store and a young man there worked for quite a while helping me out. The phone itself is great, I just am P.O.'D that no paper work came with it and the wrong charger was sent. I bought the right charger at the A.T.& T. store.",2
mcdrrt,5/25/2023,I had a technical problem with the phone.  The seller replaced it without a problem,5
Miguel Landon|Miguel Landon,5/31/2023,"|The media could not be loaded.|La verdad es el 2do equipo reacondicionado de Amazon y la verdad me llevé un muy mal sabor de boca con él, lo voy a devolver la estética del equipo es de 8.5/10 tiene ligeros rayones en la tapa trasera y las cámaras se ven todas rayadas. En general el equipo vino en muy malas condiciones estéticos en funcionamiento todo está bien, pero la estética no es su punto más fuerte|",3

Chris Maxwell,6/17/2023,"Bought this phone from these guys after months of surfing, digging and review readings. Lol. Needless to say, I for real don't see how it could have ever been used. Has to of been brand new. Love the phone. Only thing I'm upset about is the phone not having the wifi calling option enabled with my current carrier. Other than that though great purchase. Definitely would recommend getting a phone from these guys.",5
Amazon Customer,6/19/2023,"Waited to write review to see how phone would operate after using for a couple of months.I am very pleased with the phone and have had no problems at all.The phone looked and operated like a brand new phone, so if you feel a little skeptical as I was, trust me and get it , you will not be disappointed .",5
TERRIBLE,6/20/2023,I bought a phone from this person and 1-the phone had A LOT of scratches and 2-The SIM card reader didn’t work. It was unlocked but the SIM card reader wasn’t working so I wasn’t able to use any sim card on it. I WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN!!! I don’t understand how can people sell this type of trash on Amazon!!!,1
Roberto PR,6/22/2023,"El equipo llego sin estar desbloqueado por lo que no fue posible que reconociera el SIM de ATT, al igual de que no llego en condiciones excelentes como indican, la parte trasera traia muchos daños visibles a 30 cm del telefono.|",2
Amazon Customer,7/4/2023,I’ve had my phone for couple days now and it’s amazing. The battery last a long time. I was able to just put my att sims card and my service irked just fine. I also transferred everything using the sharing app. I will definitely be buying my cell phones here again. Looked just like NEW !! Thank you,5

Raven D. Miller,8/3/2023,"Needed an upgraded phone for my son before he leaves for college. Phone arrived on time. It was packaged relatively well. Was able to activate it with our carrier (Verizon) with no issue. It did come unlocked (noticed in some of the reviews left that it didn't come unlocked). Reasons I give 4 stars instead of 5 is: I paid a little extra for a refurbished phone in 'excellent condition'. I would say this phone is closer to 'good condition'). It came with a noticeable scratch going across the top of the screen and some blemishes on the side of phone where the power/volume buttons are located. It leaves me wondering what a 'good condition' phone would've looked like and if it would've been worth getting instead for the extra savings. The package came only with the wall charger but no cable. Fortunately, he was able to use his cable from his old device. I was pleased to see that the key to unlock the SIM card slot was in the box. Overall, pleased with the purchase and would more than likely do this again when ready to upgrade device.",4
Grant,8/5/2023,This came a week earlier than was expected. Very happy with that.  The phone is a gift for my son and he likes it.,5
RodWink,8/9/2023,I ordered this Samsung galaxy 21 from this website and I was out of the country for work....I arrived home last week and the phone was there with my other packages...long story short the phone doesn't work properly....you can't make calls...at&t looked at the phone and determined that it was a issue with the phone...now the seller on Amazon will Not give me a refund or exchange...be careful about who you purchase from on Amazon...everyone isn't honest...unsatisfied customer...scams like this should not be happening on Amazon...smdh,1
ET,8/29/2023,"Love the wireless charging feature, first time I tried it. This phone was in like new condition. Just had it a few days, but everything seems to work very well.

Scott,8/31/2023,"Great phone, I love it. The only thing is the battery is a little short-lived if you are on it a lot. The reviews all say the same thing. It is not this phone it is all of them. In spite of that, I still love it.",5
Jimmy Nuñez,9/3/2023,the phone works great as today,5
Cold in Wyoming,9/8/2023,"I have been buying refurbished phones for years never an issue, mostly universal unlock for all carriers.  This one showed up with no voice mail app, tried to solve finally went to Verizon and they informed me that a lot of times switching carriers, even though it's unlocked some features won't carry over.  Most of us I'm sure use the visual voice mail vs. the clunky dial into Verizon add password go through the prompts yada yada to get your voicemail.",2
Flower Girl,9/21/2023,"I love this phone so far. I bought it and didn't realize I couldn't use an SD card but it's cool because I don't really need one. It arrived quickly and in great condition. After almost a month of use, I'm a happy customer.",5
Roger Webb,9/22/2023,The speaker blew out and failed a few months after getting it. I have to use it on speakerphone. There's a Samsung app store that automatically downloads apps without your permission whether you like it or not.

Anvar Iniyatilla,10/31/2023,"When i last ordered an iphone 11 renewed i got it with 81% bh and it was like 85-90% close to new , some little scratches that cant be seen from distance. But this time with this s21 fe it is a complete jackpot, man i got almost new phone with 99% battery health and there is no scratch or anything complete new, no problems with camera,mic,audio and whatsoever, the only thing i ask to be aware of before buying renewed phones is just strictly read rewiews carefully from sellers, there are different sellers for same phones and dont be sold for less price, there was 235 and 240 bucks option , i went with 240 and hit the jackpot cause i liked 240's seller reputation and will never regret that i didnt save some money before buying, the former one had like average rating, always go for top rating sellers",5

Suzanne,11/14/2023,"I could not find a scratch or mark on this phone, so looks brand new. I am coming from Moto G Stylus phone and this took a little bit to get use to the few differences. The touch on the Samsung is not as sensitive as the Motorola but after a few days I had no problems. The connectivity to our Uconnect on truck and my smartwatch was flawless and have stayed connected without any problems. Scrolling is fast and smooth. I would easily recommend this phone.After almost 1 1/2 years I am thrilled with this phone, has updated to latest UI worked flawlessly and has great battery life.. Photos are all I expected. The company was helpful with questions I had, so I still recommend phone and Bay Trading.",5

I was not going to jump through the hoops and give my credit card number to anyone to get an unlocked code. I just ordered a different phone that was for my carrier only.But on a positive note. The phone looked beautiful, no scratches or blemishes. Turned on right away and seemed like it would have been a good one. But I cannot give a higher rating if it is advertised wrong!",1

Andrew Pavlik,12/7/2023,"Phone was unlocked, and in generally good condition, but it booted with a T-Mobile (GSM) splash screen, and Verizon confirmed it was not capable of being registered on their network despite being advertised as Verizon compatible.

Adriel Cardenas,1/22/2024,El teléfono por afuera está en excelentes condiciones parece nuevo sin embargo la funcionalidad deja mucho que desear. En mi caso la batería no alcanzaba para un día. Y adicional la señal (datos) a cada rato me decía que estaba desconectado.|,3
Nathan|Nathan,1/26/2024,"The charge does not work right out of the box, and the box came delivered damaged inside the delivery box... I would be weary of ordering an Amazon renewed phone again...if you are Canadian, I also ordered a phone from Orchard in GTA... I got my order through Canada Post in less than 48hrs, the customer service is excellent, and the phone works perfectly. I recommend them as a first choice.",3
