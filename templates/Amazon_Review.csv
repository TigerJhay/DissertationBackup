Kuamaul,,I got the phone from FEDEX and a black Buick showed up and randomly delivered my phone once I got it it was good for the first 30 mins until I opened the camera app to see that it was not working. I would open the app upfor it to give me a warning to say the camera app failed. And I tried it again for it to crash again. The phone would not update at all it would tell me that the update was interrupted and to try again in the next 24 hrs and last but certainly not least not only was it already locked to att despite me getting it unlocked but the fingerprint scanner wouldn't work and said the fingerprint scanner needed to be calibrated I tried everything I even called Samsung to tell them what's happened and they remotely controlled my phone and everything and all they could do was tell me to go to a Samsung store in which I'm in Deming NM so there are no stores where I live and he also recommended that I trade it in for  a s23 for a discounted price I even tried safe mode NOTHING worked I'm not saying don't buy from here but I'm saying to buy with caution I wish I took videos but I've already returned the phone the same day I got it.,1

Sudime|Sudime,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",I am a samsung phone user and was hoping to buy my dad a new device as his is giving him so much trouble. Before I even turned the phone on I had suspicions that it was fake there were thick bezels where there weren't supposed to be. And there was an LG looking notch at the top. I turned it on and not even to my surprise everything looked like 900th class quality I could breath nothing but pixels. This phone is worse than the samsung a series and it's an s series phone. That when I knew for sure. This phone was a fake,1
kpfrancis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024","The app that sets up the home page didn't work, so my information and apps transferred to the new phone, but I could only access my apps through the settings.  My apps weren't on the homepage.  Samsung Tech support tried to help, but they couldn't get it working.  They sent me to their contracted repair shop where the OS was reinstalled, but that didn't work either, so the tech said it was likely a defective motherboard.  I've never had an issue ordering phones on Amazon, so I'm only upset that the store that sold the phone didn't test it.",1
Heidi Baker,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2024",I was getting this for my son for Christmas to replace his old no name cell phone. Was excited that it got here in time.  Immediately started setting it up.  Wifi would not even turn on for me to even try to connect to any network!  Not happy at all!  Do not buy from this seller.  It was LIKE NEW which means everything should work!,1
nmims3013,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024","This was supposedly a Refurbished/Renewed phone. Nothing but junk. This is the second one I had to return. The first phone would not stay charged. The second phone would not show the home screen. Also two trips to my phone store. Be wise, just get a NEW phone. I only bought it as it showed ""The Amazon Renewed Store"". Usually good quality if Amazon puts their name in it. Not in thus case.",1
Christopher hermann,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024","We bought this phone and went to put a sim card in and it wouldn't recognize the metro pcs sim. We ended up going to metro to get a new sim and found out the phone was blacklisted from the network due to it being used in an insurance scam. The store wanted to call the cops on us till we explained the situation as it's technically ""stolen""",1
Elizabeth Greer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Bought this phone for my husband since he loves Samsung products and uses it with his Samsung watch 4. I even bought a rugged case with built in screen protector for it and after 5 months cellular service is always interrupted even after resetting of network and phone back to factory settings. Cannot make calls or receive calls or emails. Same way with Wi-Fi. Cell service is with cricket and have no problems with cricket at all. But then it comes up with AT&T on occasions but have no service with ATT. My Wi-Fi is good and no issues with service or modem. Cricket customer service shows everything working on their end and all numbers show current for their protocols. Don’t know what is wrong with it. Told me I should take ir to a cell phone repair store to see what they may can find out but it would cost more to fix than get a new one. So, it looks like I will be purchasing yet another phone for my husband si he can make and receive calls and email. It just sucks that it didn’t last as long as his other phone did, and reason we bought this one is because his screen and lcd screen was cracked and could not be fixed.",1
Wil Santiago,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024","The first phone came in and after setting it up, the OneUi keeps crashing. Replacement phone was delivered and same thing is happening. They must be doing something incorrect when flashing these phones at Amazon renewal department. The only thing that would get it past the loop, is to install a launcher like Nova Launcher and making it the default launcher. Not acceptable though as i like the native OneUI. Thank you",1

Kimberly,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024",Purchased this phone because it was advertised as being unlocked and compatible with Verizon Wireless. First phone came in the mail and when setting up discovered it was only compatible with AT&T. Started a refund and ordered a replacement. I also went back and double checked the phone was compatible and unlocked. Reached out to seller with no reply. Replacement came today and the EXACT same thing happened. The phone will only accept an AT&T sim card. Save yourself the trouble of returning two phones and being without a phone for three days and do NOT purchase from this seller.,1
Jaime|Jaime,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2024",Don't buy from this listing. They will send you phones that only accept Verizon SIM cards. I have been sent three Verizon phones and customer support is unhelpful and will lie that they'll send the right item or tell you to contact the seller to unlock it when it should come unlocked. They might as well change the listing from Unlocked to Verizon.,1
Old School,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","I have purchased refurbished phones in the past without any glitches, and overall I'm positive on the idea of purchasing refurbished phones in general. However, this purchase was pretty terrible. Upon setting up the phone I received repeated crash errors for the OS, which means I was never able to get into the phone at all. Then, I also received an IMEI error, stating there was no IMEI, and further there was no access to phone capabilities and no access to data network functionality. Requested a replacement which was received several days later. The replacement has the exact same problem. I would call this a complete a total fail on the part of the seller for not confirming functionality of the OS etc before sale. This seller should never be allowed to sell phones on Amazon.",1

Unfortunately I didn't find this out until I tried to update the phone when I noticed it wasn't updating. This issue is preventing the phone from updating and doing security patches.

Amazon Customer|Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024","The phone arrived in great condition, looked new and included a charger and a little pin to open the SIM. Helpful! Super cool! However, I've had this phone for a few months now and the back camera is atrocious. I'm a bit suspicious that during renewal, the camera was replaced with something cheaper. Part of why I landed on this after my Moto G 6 broke was because of the camera feature that other users raved about online, but the Motorola camera was much better. This thing pixelates horrifically, cannot zoom, barely takes color and acts like it's near sighted... I attached two photos I took with the device, the first is with zoom to show the pixelating. The second is without. The front camera works leagues better, which seems off considering the online reviews stating this device works well for photography. Replacing this after a few months was definitely not what I wanted to have to do, and my trust with refurbished phones is now a bit worn. Regardless, it did the job as a temporary replacement.",2

Jay M,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024","I bought this phone after my husband researched it for an upgrade for my mom.  She didn't need anything fancy but I wanted something middle of the road as the free upgrade was not great.  First let me say that the screen was in great condition and the phone works just fine.  However, if you are going to list a phone as refurbished in excellent condition it shouldn't come with the edges worn and scratched.  I expected a few but, this one looked as though it was put through the wringer.  Again, at least with a case it will cover some of that but, more of the principal of it being listed as excellent condition when a good condition one runs about 150.00. But honestly would have hated to see the what the good condition looked like if that is what the excellent standard is.",3

Ethan|Ethan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2023","As soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell it was a used phone. It had major scuffs on the corner aswell as around the charge port. I bought one that was supposed to be ""excellent condition"" which I thought would be like new. But it's apparent this one belongs in the ""acceptable"" category. Of course a used phone isn't gonna be perfect, but this one isn't exactly excellent condition. I'm going to put a case around it anyway, so those scuffs won't matter to much to meThe screen looks like it was replaced due to it being scratch free and it had a plastic film over it. My main concern is it might lack it's original waterproof capability because of that, unless the restorer used an OEM seal when applying the new screen.Overall, the phone works really well and there is absolutely no problems using it. I think its a great deal for a phone that is still relatively new and has a lot of life left. I like that it came with a charger in the box. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the misleading ""great condition"" factor. It also had lots of software updates to download the first couple days of use.",3

Naively I thought that an unlocked phone was good to go and of course you can't access an imei number to check in advance.  We were phoneless for about a week.  Thank goodness all we usually get are junk calls.  Down to the xfinity store we go.  This particular brand, we found out later, DOES NOT WORK MOST OF THE TIME even if it is unlocked.  Then starts the arduous process of reordering another model and returning this one and the case I ordered.  I really needed to chat with Amazon but neither my Amazon app nor my computer could point me to customer service.  They just wanted to automate everything.  I needed help.  Anyway, what I learned is that even an unlocked phone often does not work if your carrier is different from what the phone had been used on.  So do you feel lucky?  Too bad the phone looked new.

Although it's finicky, it does charge to 100% and it holds the charge well. The camera is pretty dang good on this too!2 week update: The charging port barely works at all now. I noticed it was a bit weird the first day I got it, and I incorrectly assumed that it wouldn't be much of a problem. But it worsened pretty quickly and it's now at the point where it barely charges at all. It's disappointing because this phone was advertised as being in ""excellent condition"".

Raven D. Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023","Needed an upgraded phone for my son before he leaves for college. Phone arrived on time. It was packaged relatively well. Was able to activate it with our carrier (Verizon) with no issue. It did come unlocked (noticed in some of the reviews left that it didn't come unlocked). Reasons I give 4 stars instead of 5 is: I paid a little extra for a refurbished phone in 'excellent condition'. I would say this phone is closer to 'good condition'). It came with a noticeable scratch going across the top of the screen and some blemishes on the side of phone where the power/volume buttons are located. It leaves me wondering what a 'good condition' phone would've looked like and if it would've been worth getting instead for the extra savings. The package came only with the wall charger but no cable. Fortunately, he was able to use his cable from his old device. I was pleased to see that the key to unlock the SIM card slot was in the box.

It is a great deal cheaper, and I am happy with my purchase. I paid $218 for a one-year old flagship phone.I selected an ""excellent"" condition phone. It came with a glass screen protector, which disrupted the AMOLED display, so I removed it, and noticed a couple of larger scratches that were imperceptible with the protector on. This is not quite according to the description, which is partially why I have my review at a 4-star.The only other issue I have had is battery life. I believe that this phone is running at about 80% battery health. I am a *very* heavy user, and so I have to run the phone with battery saver activated to make it through a full day, but that isn't that huge of a deal. Samsung's battery saver is relatively unobtrusive. However, I may opt for a higher quality renewed phone in the future.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and highly recommend this process to others.",4

It is.The phone was a refurbished one and I have to say it was like new. The battery is a bit off what reviews state a new S21 should be but it is a refurb which was clearly advertised to be ""At least"" 80% of new so it is as described.The worst thing of the S21 compared to the S8 is the camera. The S8 camera is excellent but the S21 is pretty bad (when I've been use to the S8 quality for years). It is actually tempting to get a new screen from my S8 and toss the S21 due to the really obvious poor quality of teh S21 camera. This is a Samsung issue though.The vendor: Accurate description, Excellent product and fast deliverySamsung: Cop on and bring back the S8 camera!",5

I had the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE prior to this one, but was ready to upgrade a little bit and this has been an amazing phone so far. It's very fast and runs great. I have noticed that it can run a little hot at times but not anything I'm super worried about. And it did come with a teeny tiny little chip in the top right corner but it is super hard to notice. It actually took me two days to realize it was even there so nothing to really complain about considering it is a used phone. Other than that one small tiny tiny blemish there are no others. No scratches on the screen or even the back. I'd definitely recommend buying this! It's definitely worth the price.",5

When they said ""excellent quality - almost new"" they meant it.  Not a scratch on it.  Wonderful refurbishment. As for the phone itself, it's everything I remember about an S series Galaxy...except for the lack of a power button. I haven't had one since the S9, so maybe I'm just out of the loop, but that threw me a little.  Still doesn't take away from the phone though.  Very fast.  Wonderful picture quality. A bunch of space, which I adore. The quality of call sound is perfect.  I'm very happy with my purchase",5

All specifications are subject to the actual product. *Devices complying with the 5 ATM-rated water have a water resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. This means that they may be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. It has smartwatch looks, but the Watch Fit is best thought of as an advanced-looking exercise tracker that pulls off telling you the time and delivering notifications better than anything Fitbit or Samsung offers at the price. It is great, and definitely one of the best fitness trackers around.

Late review

Nag order agad ako nito nung pag ka-list nila dito. Got early bird and shopee voucher and i got it for 4,899 only. Ang daming freebies and expected ko lang is yung buds pero meron pa travel Kit (tote + tumbler) na maganda rin quality. 

Ang ganda nung watch kasi can be connected sa ios buti nag delay ako pag bili nung ?? watch and nakita ko to medyo limited yung pwede gawin using ios pero goods na sya for its price and na connect man sya sa ios compare sa other brands na cannot be talaga. 

Napalitan ko na rin sya straps and nalagyan tempered para safe na safe! 

Thank you huawei!

Best feature is the battery life. I've been using it for three whole days, and the battery percentage is at 51%. And I was shocked by all the freebies 1. Earbuds with great sound quality 2. Tote bag 3. Tumbler.

When it comes to smartwatch naman sobrang sulit ang upgrade from mi band 5. Ganitong watch kasi yung hinahanap ko merong jumping rope na option as workout. Sobrang premium din ng feels pagsuot. At ang sobrang gusto ko dito is compatible sya sa ios.

Thank you Huawei! Didn’t expect the freebies! I was wondering why the box was so big knowing I only bought a watch ?? Got me more excited about the mug and free buds! ?? But the watch is great. A lot of features. It’s my first smart watch anyway. Not bad for a first. Will probably wear this whole week to test its battery life. I hope it will last long. Thank you so much! Got this for only 5000 with spaylater ??

Pricey than other brands pero worth it talaga yung money mo dito compared sa basic watch ng ibang brands. Sulit. Masarap suotin, madaming functions, mukhang apple watch. Nakuha ko noong first release. With discount voucher and pay later at zero interest. Worth the budol overall if u have extra money to spend.

The Huawei Watch Fit 3 (NFC variant) impresses with its sleek design, vibrant AMOLED display, and robust fitness tracking capabilities. The addition of NFC for contactless payments is a game-changer, making everyday tasks more convenient. Battery life is excellent, lasting days on a single charge. Highly recommend for those seeking a stylish and functional smartwatch.

kimbanaag,6/24/2024 12:58,"Best Feature:Health App. The health monitor is very helpful for us. I have been having chest pains and I think this would help me very much in keeping track of my heart rate. I personally love the sleep monitor, as I have seizures during sleep resulting to prolonged sleep paralysis with auditory and visual hallucinations. Battery life is really great!
Performance:Very smooth and very responsive to touch.
Product Quality:Superior quality. When I got the watch at around 2pm the battery was at 77%, after all the tweaking and checking around with light workout up to almost 9pm it's still at 70%.

I highly recommend Huawei smart watches. I recently purchased Kids watch 4 Pro for my son and daughter and their watches are doing great. I'm thinking of purchasing Watch fit 3 for both of them in the near future to help keep track of their health. Great job, Huawei!

Oh, thank you for the coffee cup freebies! My husband and I are coffee lovers so these are great freebies for us ??

I have been using it for 4 days - received at 79% and today it’s down to 38% which is good for its functionality. Very sleek design and the wrist movement doesn’t feel heavy. Anyways, I don’t regret buying it - been praying for an iwatch since last year and this is a blessing to have a fraction of its price and the perks are even more impressive.

Thank you so much Seller and the delivery was smooth as well. I thought it’s preordered and was dated to be delivered on August 2. I ordered last July 18 and received it by July 22.

I’ve tested my fair share of Huawei smartwatches, and while they come in all different price ranges, the one common trait among them was that they all resembled classic wristwatches with a circular design and raised bezel. Not the Huawei Watch Fit 3, which from afar (and maybe even up close), looks like an Apple Watch.

I tried it muna before giving a feedback and so far so good, dumatkng sya na may battery life so I drained it muna and recharge it. I love that its battery doesn’t drain agad agad, it took me 6 days before sya malowbatt, from 100 to 15% in 6 days, and it charged so fast din, I think it depends sa adaptor na gamit, in my case I used my phones adaptor na 33w and 1hr of charging lang sya, I also tried charging it using the other adaptor that has lower W and matagal syang mag charge hehe so tip na gumamit ng hight W ng adaptor for fast charging.

I previously used huawei watch band 7 and the battery is superb and accurate sleep tracking. 10x better than my apple watch???? Fast delivery, within 24hrs.
