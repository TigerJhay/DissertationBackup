Kindle Client,11/7/2024,"An excellent cost benefit, this one more than a week ago, check out a few days before the deadline. With a very large, extremely fluid fabric, I am able to play and do day-to-day tasks calmly without work. The assisting experience is excellent, the fabric is very good and the audio is also due to four night outings. Buy it to help our studies and do not be disappointed, it meets all your needs. This is two days without charging and now that the battery is at 54%, it charges relatively quickly, the charger is turbo more due to the size of the battery and it takes about 2 hours to charge, which doesn't bother me. Enfim, the product is excellent and I highly recommend it.|",5,Redmi Pad SE
Wayne,1/19/2025,"8gb of RAM & 256GB HDD, with a latest SnapDragon CPU, Four speakers, 2 top & bottom, offers good sound for little speakers, plus it has Dolby ATMOS. Very good battery life, more so in dark mode and battery saver. Fast opening of apps and good performance all around. Graphics very good and copes with everything but the serious gaming level, which would cost much more. It has a super metal alloy finish, and good quality glass, so get it protected with a tempered glass screen protector, and case for the Tablet body I think the likes of Samsung are going to be forced into dropping their prices, as an equivalent would be in the £500+ range, I used to buy Samsung tablets and their very good, but so are these with equivalent build and performance, plus being much cheaper. It arrives in a heavy stock cardboard box, and nicely packaged. Its rated as 10 WATT charging, but I can tell you if you get a 20 Watt charger you'll receive 17 watt charging fate, with ""fast charging"" appearing on the screen, so it can be charged respectively fast enough so not to hinder usage, buy a 3 meter lead and use while charging so you've plenty of lead to move about with. Comes preloaded with a latest version of Android, and receives regular updates. Plus it has a nice cleaning app built in. With very little blotware Apps.. For well under £200 you getting an 11"" screen alloy body with a lot of spec, very much well worth buying. They also do a 4GB RAM & 128GB version, and this also has great spec just less storage and RAM, but plenty to still be an excellent purchase.",5,Redmi Pad SE

Ali,9/5/2024,"Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE: A Budget Champion When it comes to affordable Android tablets, we often expect a familiar story: mediocre build quality, outdated internals, sluggish performance, and a short lifespan. But the Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE defies those expectations. It's the first Xiaomi device I've used, and I must say, I'm impressed—even though this is a budget tablet1. Here's why the Redmi Pad SE stands out: Impressive 90Hz Refresh Rate: What sets this tablet apart in its price range is its 90Hz refresh rate. Most budget-friendly tablets stick to the standard 60Hz, but the Redmi Pad SE steps up the game. With smoother animations, fluid transitions, and remarkably responsive scrolling, it feels surprisingly premium2. Solid Build Quality: The metal body of the Redmi Pad SE feels good in hand. Xiaomi didn't compromise on materials, and it shows. You won't mistake it for a flimsy paperweight anytime soon. Decent Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 4G, the tablet handles everyday tasks well. Whether you're browsing, streaming, or multitasking, it won't leave you frustrated. Multimedia Features: Quad Speakers: The Redmi Pad SE boasts quad speakers, making media consumption enjoyable. Expandable Storage: With 128GB of storage (expandable via microSD card), you won't run out of space for your apps and files. High-Refresh Display: The 11-inch IPS LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate ensures a pleasant viewing experience. Affordable Price: The Redmi Pad SE won't break the bank. At around $240 for the 128GB/8GB model, it's easy on your wallet. Plus, you get three color options: Mint Green, Graphite Gray, and Lavender Purple. Of course, there are some trade-offs: Graphics performance isn't mind-blowing. No official support for an active stylus. No fingerprint scanner.",5,Redmi Pad SE
Net Solution,7/28/2024,"Pour le prix je ne pense pas que l'on pourrait faire mieux. It is assez réactive, intègre 256Go de stockage. Pour les enfants c'est largement suffisant. It is also a beautiful one.|",5,Redmi Pad SE

Avi,1/21/2025,I’m an apple guy but wanted an android device. Most budget android tablets are trash and run slow. This one one highest spec is less than the cheapest iPad and runs just as good. And now I get all the benefits of having android too. The interface is iPad like which makes it easy to switch to. Best tablet for the price!,5,Redmi Pad Pro WiFi
George Walker|George Walker,12/24/2024,"I wish the 11-in have the higher L1 Winevine certificate so I can watch TV shows and YouTube on 4K at 60 frames per second and HDR. The chipset on that tablet as the capabilities but for some strange reason the manufacturer then op for a better certificate for the capabilities to reflect the performance on the tablet. Now ask for for the bigger one the 12-in pro, it checks all the boxes at the 11th inch one didn't. Even though both of their speakers are very loud which I can't take away from the 11 inch and the value for the money is the same price as the 11-in. They both had actually screen quality in my opinion. And the color options are pretty cool. I barely watch TV now since I got this big boy. With 8gb of RAM and 256 of storage with expansion slot of a terabyte or more SD card, you can't go wrong.",5,Redmi Pad Pro WiFi

lunchbox,10/3/2024,I like the tablet but I really hate the silly restrictions. I am unable to unlock my bootloader because you must apply for a code and the queue is ALWAYS full.  You can't use Bluetooth to unlock your device unless it's Xiaomi device.  I do wish the SOC wasn't just another rebranded chip.  Xiaomi really shouldn't get you money and I regret buying this tablet.,3,Redmi Pad Pro WiFi

Eu vim por indicação de avaliação de um canal do YT que assisti após comparar vários tablets pra comprar e indicou essa loja. O único ponto negativo até agora tem sido a falta da Nota Fiscal, mas aumentarei a nota assim que receber.Funções e Compatibilidade:BATERIA:Carregamento total em 1h30.No primeiro dia 20/09 eu usei bastante, por 12h, pra testar apps, jogos, tela, funções, tudo bom. Usei o dia todo pra testar recarregamento de bateria e deixei ir até 2% pra carregar.Ficou ligado 2 dias usando por 6 a 8h/dia em Modo Econômico de bateria e descarregou só até 60%, então gostei muito da bateria.- 15Out2024: bateria realmente boa. Joguei, assisti filmes, desenhei, li livros e a bateria durou quase 3 dias sem precisar carregar. Nunca deixe a bateria zerar pra carregar, quando estiver entre 3% e 5% recarregue, assim vai durar muitos anos. Faço isso com meus aparelhos e nunca dão problema com bateria. Peguei essa dica com técnico de informática e nunca mais tive problema de bateria viciada.BLUETOOTHEle aceita dupla tela no notebook, tv ou celular através do bluetooth.Consegui jogar nele com um joystick paralelo (marca Aolion) via bluetooth tranquilamente. Airbuds Xiaomi, Airbuds paralelo e fone de ouvido estofados com ANC ativo, todos via bluetooth deu tudo ok. Conecta tranquilamente com impressora, laptop, tv, teclado, joystick paralelo e com celular tbm Xiaomi. Não testei em outras marcas de celular.- 15Out2024: conecta bem com celular e tv da marca Samsung, pra fazer streaming de tela pra assistir vídeos. Mas não dá pra assistir em 4k, somente até 1024, mas foi ótimo.SOMA saída de som dele é boa mas achei que seria mais alta, tem entrada pra cabo de som tbm, muito bom, não perde qualidade. Fiz testes de som no Spotify, YouTube e Chrome, avaliando cada um com saída das caixinhas, pelo bluetooth e pelo cabo. Padrão de celular Xiaomi.Para assistir filmes ou ouvir músicas sem fone é bom, mas com fone é bem melhor a qualidade dos graves e volume no geral.TELAA tela realmente tem qualidade de imagem acima da média, imagem nítida com cores realistas. As paletas de cores ficam fidedignas. Boa para desenho, pintura e impressão. Eu comprei pela qualidade da tela, para uso de desenhos para Tattoo. Preciso de cores corretas para não errar tonalidade das tintas, e esse tablet realmente ajudou nisso.Quando usa o Modo Leitura 👁️, que corrige a coloração pra retirar a luz azul, fica muito bom pra ler livros e PDFs, facilita pra estudo sem forçar tanto os olhos. Pra ativar, só puxar pra baixo e ir no desenho do olho. Não esqueça de desativar para voltar a desenhar e ver as cores mais vivas novamente.-15Out2024: Para assistir filmes e YT, não sei ainda qual o motivo de não carregar 4k, só vai até 1024. Quando tento assistir em 4k, a tela fica branca. Eu devo ter perdido alguma informação no manual sobre ir ou não até 4K. Obtendo mais informações, eu trago aqui.ESCREVER, DESENHAR E TOUCHEscrever com dedo ou caneta com ponta de borracha/alumínio/plásticos (pen universal) dão na mesma, pois não têm rejeição de palma para estes.ATENÇÃO pra não gastar grana: NÃO é compatível com qualquer caneta stylus. Para ter rejeição de palma, a Xiaomi aprontou a brincadeira de criar uma caneta só pra esse tablet, e já fui atrás, o nome e ""Xiaomi Redmi Smart Pen"". Não gastem grana com uma Xiaomi Focus Pen pois ela só é compatível até a versão anterior desse pad, que seria o Redmi Pad SE, não serve pra essa versão Pad Pro. Fui atrás de várias rewiews, conversei com muitos vendedores de alguns países e fui ao site da Xiaomi do Brasil e Chinês. E só essa ""Xiaomi Redmi Smart Pen"" é compatível com rejeição de palma e conecta perfeitamente com traço sem falha. Fiz o pedido fora e assim que chegar, trago atualização aqui. Também fiz o pedido da POCO Pen (pois é a versão japonesa desse tablet, que o Japão comprou parte da fábrica lá).-09Out24: ainda aguardando as canetas chegarem, assim que chegarem, eu trago atualizações do que funciona. Quem tem pressa, como eu, tô usando uma canetinha universal dessas de 10 reais pra ir desenhando e escrevendo, só não esqueça de não encostar a mão pra não perder o traço.CAPA E TECLADOVi um pessoal falando lorota aí que não têm capa e teclado pra ele, mas tem sim! Basta buscar por ""Case Redimi Pad Pro 12.1"". Vão achar de couro, de plástico, de todo jeito, algumas até parecidas com capinha do Kindle.Ele conecta em teclado bluetooth também. Eu o conectei no teclado do meu iPad antigo e deu bom, mas só fiz pra teste. Há capinhas com teclado a venda aqui e em sites de outros países.  Eu pedi de fora tbm, assim que chegar posto atualizações. Comprei colorido com luz led bem frufru - já basta minha alma triste com o parcelamento desses boletos, deixa eu me divertir com os brilhinhos do teclado, a capinha de madame e aproveitar minha compra hehehe.-15Out2024: capinha com teclado chegou da China, não tem marca, abre em Flip, fecha desligando a tela. Tecladinho frufru bonitinho, conecta bem e ainda ganhei um mouse que tbm conecta. Vira quase um mini notebook. Achei firmeza pra estudos, pois cabe na minha bolsa. E da pra usar sem teclado tbm, só tirar, ele fica preso como um imã e lembra aquelas versões Samsung Galaxy Tab. Comprei com um desse de uma amiga, e parece demais. Enfim. Qualquer tecladinho (sem pendrive) funciona via bluetooth.NOTA FISCALAssim que o vendedor enviar a nota fiscal atualizo as estrelinhas aqui tambem.-9out24: nada de Nota Fiscal ainda. Vendedor tinha pedido 10 dias úteis. Cadê, minha nota, vendedor???-15Out2024... Cadê minha Nota Fiscal, vendedor? Já acionei a ouvidoria da Amazon. Ah nem, estou ficando estressada!Se gostou da avaliação, deixa like que sempre que compro, faço atualizações detalhadas de tempos em tempos. Eu volto pra avaliar uso de produtos a cada 2-3 meses por até 2 anos, falando a realidade do uso, se deu problema (e como resolvi). Podia ser pago mas faço isso só pq eu sofri muito indo atrás de produto e não achei avaliações assim.Avaliação inicial em 25 Set 2024.|",5,Redmi Pad Pro WiFi

Ryan S.|Ryan S.,8/10/2024,"Hello, this is my first review on Amazon. This review comes courtesy of a longtime Samsung user. Included is a picture of my S9 FE+ 256GB next to my second S6 Tab Lite (I lost the first one ;( ) shot on a S20 FE 5G. I will be comparing to my S6 Tab Lite. I really like the S6 Lite. I got it for $200 at Walmart (for both S6's). For comparison, I was given a Nexus 7 back in 2012, which was also purchased for $200. The Nexus is now 12 yo, and barely works. Using the S6 has been awesome. It's only chugged during intensive moments in gaming, and it only froze for a second or two. With three times the RAM as the S6, I don't think I'll have any problems for a long time.nThe size of the S6 Tab Lite is a lot more manageable for me. I could use it (the S6) one handed if I was only really using one half of the screen. I definitely can't with this! That being said, as somebody who's working on an engineering undergrad degree, I found the screen of the S6 too small. This screen feels big enough to use on most days. And with 256 GB instead of 64 GB, I can have games and lots of notes.A few notes: the S9 pen is a bit thicker and has a smaller button than the S6 pen. Second, I was getting better rear photos on the S6 than the S9, I don't know why. I hope it's user error. I'll update you on that. Finally, the S6 feels slimmer in my hand even though they're the same thickness, thanks to the S6 having rounded corners versus the sharper/more upright edges on the S9.Conclusion: For relaxation, the S6 is better, assuming you're not playing hard-core games (it ran fine on Honkai ... on the lowest settings). For work, the extra real estate pays dividends and with a good keyboard case, should be good to replace the laptop most of the time.Proper Review:When I wrote this originally, I didn't have the Samsung portfolio case. I left a review there about a month ago. (Short and sweet: It's very expensive, but it's also perfectly suited to what I need from this device. Backlighting would be nice, but I don't find it to be as much of an issue as I did a month ago.) Update on the camera: I think I smudged up the camera when grabbing the first time. I took a picture of an outdoor scene, and although it wasn't sharp, it wasn't really fuzzy either. I haven't done a side-by-side comparrison with the S6 Lite though. I'll update this update if I determine that smudges weren't the cause of the picture quality deficit.I learned about more software features, like RAM+ and wireless mirroring. In options, it gives the ability for up to 8 GB of virtual RAM. However, I also noted that 4 GB of RAM+ was selected and turned on by default. When I turned it off, it still showed up as 12 GB. Hopefully, this means I can have 20 GB of RAM, although I can't possibly imagine I'd need that many. I've noticed that the tablet seems to use at minimum around 4-5 GB of RAM. Makes me wonder how the S6 Lite manages to run Honkai Star Rail. I've seemed to have more performance issues in games than the S6 on higher settings, but the battery life is much better. It feels like this will never die! The S6 could only do 3-4 hours of gaming, but this can do much more, I think atleast twice as much, maybe triple? This also has faster charging speeds. Let me demonstrate the battery life. I have 1hr 15 minute classes. With note-taking almost the entire time, this went down 7%. At that rate, that's probably almost 16 hours of on-screen time!This tablet really is something special, especially with the portfolio case. It's small enough that I feel comfortable walking a mile to class with this in my hands (in a 13' Macbook case lol), and it's big enough that I can get work done on it - as long as I'm not constantly switching tabs. Windows is better for rearranging tabs, although Samsung provides more freedom - I just don't find that freedom useful personally. I still stand by my opinion that gaming is easier on the smaller screen - I accidentally pressed the accelerator in RR3 numerous times on the S9 FE+, but that never happened on the S6 Lite.Anyways, that's it for me. I'd highly recommend getting the extra RAM, especially if you're like me who was raised to use stuff until it falls apart. If you're a student, I couldn't recommend this tablet more strongly.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
4 Lil Lambs,11/1/2024,"I absolutely love this brand's tablets. This is my second one. But probably the fourth tablet for my family to purchase. First one lasted almost three and a half years before I had trouble with it. Then another five before it gave up the ghost.I love the upgrade of the pen. This was my one big reason with go with another samsung over say a fire. And I was thrilled with how well this tablet handled my artwork.Since getting I've been on it a lot. I love the bigger screen (In comparison to my phone) The high speed under which it works.If I could change or improve this, I don't think I would. The pen was my main complaint in the past, but I am thrilled on how they included, and upgraded it and how smoothly it works.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Stephen the Ex-Monk,12/20/2024,"Like any mobile device from Samsung, this tablet is well built and will last a few years if not abused.I'm not over fond of the Samsung special apps loaded and I tend to squash any I can. This is one reason I wish I could get a Pixel tablet with the same features, I do not like bloat.Aside from the unneeded software, it's pleasing to use. Some things are different from my old Tab S-3, but it's quite a few years newer so that's expected.Of note, the included S-pen will magnetically attach to the back of your tablet. This is a nice feature but also I don't trust it to keep my pen in place. I purchased a case which takes advantage of the magnet but uses an elastic strap to ensure it stays where its supposed to be.The fingerprint reader is on the power button and I've found it both natural to use and accurate. You can adjust the navigation controls to be either a three button configuration or a gesture type. I prefer the three button. Unlike the S3, these buttons are not a part of the physical devie and instead are onscreen. This gives you the ability to both change the position of the buttons (mine are right of center) you can also change the order so the back button is on the left like most other Android devices. Oddly, I am so used to having my tablet with back button on the right instead of left that I just left it there.When I activated the mobile connection, Verizon downloaded an e-sim to it instead of using the included nano-sim. It also didn't activate immediately and I don't know why. Eventually I successfully activated it and conclude the range is just as good as my phone. I'm not 100% sure buying with the 5G mobile connection was wise, but that's a personal decision.Outside of the question of whether getting 5G was a good idea, there's no question this is a good product and worth buying.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Farren Farret,12/8/2024,If you are debating getting this tablet i suggest you dong and just get it! the battery life is so good it last up to two days. I use my tablet for college and for illustrations and it works like heaven. On top of this the features are so cool like veing able to use it as a computer or being able to use it as a second monitor. This feature definetly has been helpful as i work on my laptop and need noted open on the side. it’s also decently customizable bc you can change the pen cursor as you’d like. This definetly more worth it than an Ipad in comparison because you’re not spending another $100 for a pen.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
3N☆°,7/23/2024,"I bought this to make art and as soon as I touched the top of the S Pen to the screen I was blown away by how smooth and soft the feel is against the screen. Set up was quick and easy. It's even easier if you already have Google and Samsung accounts.It doesn't come with a charger block, only a type c to type c wire, which left me with no choice but to use a random off brand type c charger with a Samsung type A block which I hope won't mess with the battery or life span of this thing.The metallic lavender color is gorgeous and warm, quite similar to the pink HP Stream 14. The S Pen is a pastel, chalky lavender in a cooler tone.This tablet is razor thin, relatively lightweight for its size (perfect for drawing) and has a fantastic display.The user interface is typical of samsungs and androids. Unfortunately, Samsung phone themes are not compatible but you can customize the icons by selecting color schemes that match your wallpaper.Sounds quality is pretty good. It doesn't get too loud. To start, I played a mobile game and watched YouTube. Both experiences were hiccup-free and great on such a large, clear screen.The tablet comes with PENUP already on it, so artists who are just getting back into digital drawing will enjoy the app and its new, intuitive user interface.The S-pen has handwrite to text features that kick in automatically upon pairing with either your tablet or Samsung phone. I tried this S pen with both and the features come built into the pen!",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Mike Richart,12/10/2024,"Buying a new tablet is always hard. So many compromises to make since price is always an issue. I'm glad I picked the Tab 9 fe.Great color and faster than my older Tab.  This is my 4th Galaxy tablet, so I'm pretty comfortable in the Samsung universe. Even so, it takes a minute to learn the new features.Transferring from my old device was easy. Samsung walks you right through it.  A really Big Plus for me is the ability to mount a micro SD card. I added 256 gig. Gives me room.Charging is fast. Samsung doesn't include a wall wart, but I guess we all have a bunch. USB-C cable is Included.The S-Pen is new to me. The pen included is the 'dumb version so some advancedfeatures are not available.  An upgrade is available for purchase, if you want it.I'm not a Power User and this tablet is great for me.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Amazon Customer,11/9/2024,"I absolutely enjoy my new tablet. Price was high, this said, prior to this one i got the Doogee, and had to immediately returned it back to amazon. So i went for the brand i know is reputable. And I did. It was so easy to set up. The style can do everything: draw, notation, and even highlight. Perfect for what i need it for.  The sound from the speaker are clear, love the wide screen. the images as sharp  love the graphics. I still have to learn how to use some of the apps i downloaded like the song book for my guitar. Now I take my guitar lessons on the road with me or any trips i have and never miss out on reading, or my guitar lessons. I also play games and movies. Perfect tablet for my needs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

Kat W,1/6/2025,"My old Samsung tablet stopped receiving updates in 2019, so I figured it was time for a new one. After so much looking and comparing many brands and sizes, I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2023 in silver.Some of the layout and apps look similar to my old tablet, but many things have improved. The tablet seems fast, and charges fast (I purchased a fast Samsung charger separately). I like the fingerprint-scanning button (when the tablet is not locked). The S pen is responsive, even with a glass screen protector installed. I'm not into taking a lot of pictures, so the camera is fine for me. The sound is fine for me as well. since I just need the basics, nothing fancy, and I'm not a gamer.I got rid of some preinstalled apps, some that I was able to remove; others that I couldn't remove I disabled. I added some of my own apps, and added some music on an SD card. I like the note-taking app that was preinstalled.The Tab S9 is the right size for me to use as an e-book reader. I have a case with a hand strap, so I usually hold my tablet to read or check email. There are many things that can be customized on this tablet, including accessibility features. I'm liking this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
KralosJr|KralosJr,12/23/2024,"I just bought it on black Friday and I couldn't be happier about the purchase, the tablet feels very good, good quality, the Dex help mode is very useful, especially for people who need to have several apps open at once, the excellent multitasking. I haven't tried the battery as much but so far it's according to my needs, I have the 65W Samsung charger and I charge the tablet in 1h 30m, so I have no battery issues.Working with the S Pen is very comfortable, writing with it along, with palm rejection is very useful.I haven't tried it as much in games but having a common use have been very fluid the experience, The processor isn't high-end but so far I've done well in the games I've tried.What I like most is its integration with the Samsung ecosystem, I have an S22+ and passing files between devices is very easy, even to PC through Samsung Flow, the connection is very fast.For the use that the one wanted, which was basically for the University, it is really useful to take notes and work on Word or PowerPoint, even more if you add an inhalable keyboard with trackpad. Plus, it's great for watching media, with a good screen and great speakers.Being able to expand your memory using an SD card is something that is strange about today's phones and allows you to expand storage in a very easy way.I am a loyal Samsung user and I have not been disappointed with this Galaxy Tab S9 FE, if you are thinking of buying it, I recommend it.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Kat in AZ,1/21/2025,"When I ordered this tablet, I was thinking it was pretty much the same size as most tablets my family owns and the one I was replacing, but it was a bit larger screen size. It is pretty close to the same weight as the one I was replacing, but has more memory and it works great. The stylus is so easy to use, and it attaches to the back of the tablet magnetically. I bought a case that has an open area for the stylus, with an elastic band to hold it securely, so I don't have to worry about losing the stylus, I am very pleased with this tablet overall.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

James S.|James S.,12/7/2024,"This purchase was for my wife for Christmas. She has previously owned two Samsung Tab As. This was a tremendous upgrade for her. She says that the operating system in almost identical to her S24 phone. My first complaint is that Samsung did not include a charging block with this device. Many of the charging blocks available on Amazon have less than stellar reviews. The buyer is left to their own devices to find the most appropriate charging block online or in a retail store. This is sad considering how many iterations of charging blocks manufacturers have gone through in the past 5 to 10 years. Another complaint is that the tab (and separately ordered accessories) arrived in a box with no cushioning material, literally clanging around but this is an Amazon problem and has nothing to do with the quality of the device.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

Also, the sound quality blew me away, especially considering that it's coming from a tablet.

Things that are important to me are storage, processing input, portability , durability, accessory compatibility, and  dual functionality.

I'm still learning how to get used to that. I'm able to have multiple screens open and split the screen to view them at once. This is incredibly important for me and what I bought the tablet for.

The tablet and smaller items were loose inside the outer packing box.I removed tablet from it's tight paper wrap to find the screen covered in fingerprints.Also, one tiny scratch on the back, about an inch long, otherwise it looks brand new.I suspect it was opened gently, fondled admiringly, then regret-returned, but who knows?It hardly seems worth returning for a new one, but Amazon, my friend, you get a 0/5 on this one.I can't give that kind of oversight a free pass, hence the review.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

John Galt 2021,10/16/2023,"Updates will be posted on the top.Update #3 12/07/23My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0  Quick download and install no problems.Update #2 10/30/23I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow.  One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the ""strict power saving"" mode.  i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app.  So, I changed the power saving mode to ""optimizzed' and everything worked fine.Update #1 - 10/19/23.I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger.  It took 50 minutes.  The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.It came a day early.  The packaging was excellent.I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8.  I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9"" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger.  The battery was at 51%.  I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick.  I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8.  The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying.  it went pretty quick.All the apps except two copied.  One for some reason is not compatible with the S9.  The other I was able to install from Google Play.  After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps.  The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8.  At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem.  The extra .4"" in the display over the A8 is nice.  The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.I haven't tried any games since I don't play them.  I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.As far as the OS goes.  It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1.  However, the Android security update was Aug 1st.  I imagine it will update soon enough.  Google Play was June 2023.  It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.That is it for now.  I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.Another excellent product from Samsung.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

MISS PRINGLE,8/24/2024,"For a long time, I was strongly considering purchasing a new laptop computer.  I looked at and pondered over the many choices before finally deciding on choosing a new tablet.  I'm so glad I made that decision!The thing I love most about this tablet is its size!  It's about the same size as a small laptop, but with all the advantages of the Android platform.  I love Android!This tablet is fast, and there is a ton of storage space.  The only negative I have found is the same as on my previous Samsung tablet:  Some keys on the keyboard are ""wonky"" (for lack of a better word).  By this I mean, that when typing on the touchscreen, there are times when the key pressed results in a different letter, or even a number.  The ""T,"" for example, will often result in the number ""5,"" right above it.  I'm sure this is my fault somehow,  but it's irritating, nonetheless.Other than that small, occasional issue, I find this tablet to be a cut above my previous Samsung tablet, which had served me well, also.  But, it was time for an upgrade!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Kihan Kim,12/20/2024,The big screen make the wonderful view,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Diana Cornwell,10/30/2024,"I’m making this review on the S9 tablet even though it was returned.  The tablet works great, the visuals are nice. The reason for the return is that it was too large and cumbersome for the individual who was going to use it.  He needed a smaller tablet to use.  This definitely is a good tablet.  I gave it four stars only because it was too large.  Otherwise it is worth 5 stars.",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
TRCIII,10/2/2024,"When my previous Galaxy tablet with S Pen began failing, I found out they no longer made that size tablet, with the minimum now being 10.9"", and I wasn't sure I was going to like it.I don't.  I LOVE IT!  Crisp display, smarter ""Smart Switch"" and built-in technology to lead you through initial setup than I remember from previous upgrades, made the changeover completely painless. Took a 1 TB memory card without issue.  Sound is better than you'd expect from a tablet this size, certainly superior to my old model.  S Pen feels sturdier (especially the pen tip) than others I've had.All in all, a great addition to the Galaxy family of Tablets with S Pen.A few weeks later:Love my Tab more than ever, every day I use it. Someone asked a question (which I was unable to answer or find again) about OTG adapter use. I put in an adapter and added on a 2 TB external SSD with no issues, was able to effect file transfers, play music off the external drive, with no issues. If you need more than the 1 TB that you can add as internal storage, no worries, theres's always a way to access more storage.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
Larry M. Bergelt,11/16/2024,"I am so glad I went ahead and bought this tablet. My last tablet was a Samsung from Verizon. Unfortunately, it and its case have seen better days.

druff09,12/3/2024,"Ordered this tablet for my son's homeschooling and wasn't disappointed.  I'm not exactly an apple enthusiast, but I can't deny how well they make tablets, and how well they hold up over time.  Like all apple devices, it's super easy to use and apple FINALLY uses USB for charging which is convenient.

It is more like browsing the web using my desktop screen, and movies are large enough that it is almost all I use anymore for TV.  It is also very nice to be able to have more apps open and not have them immediately be shifted to background not running (my old Air was always losing my place even to switch just between maybe 3 apps).",5,iPad Air 13inch M2

Greatly appreciated that you have to sign or provide a code when it is delivered to you; they are not going to just leave it at the door.  Deliver took longer than expected, several delays, but we purchased it during the holidays and delays are expected during that time. Wish we had purchased 2 at the time. Wonderfully designed, so many features, you can't go wrong with Apple products.

DLMinKS,10/23/2024,"Overall, I love this tablet. I debated between the 13"" and the 11"" and went with the 13"" because I'm getting older and my eyesight is not as good as it once was (need cataract surgery soon). A bigger screen sounded good and I thought 11"" wasn't much of an upgrade from my old tablet, and the price wasn't that much more than the 11"" - enough to make me think twice, but I thought it would be worth it. I thought 11"" might be enough, but 13"" would be a sort of insurance for the future as my eyes get worse.  But ... 13"" is too bulky. I should have gone with 11"". It's uncomfortable to hold or situate on my lap. And somewhat awkward for travel (plane, car).",4,iPad Air 13inch M2

Mark Ashworth,8/11/2024,This model boots up very quickly when I power it on. I appreciate that. The battery runs down faster than i expected but the included charger works fast. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the high price. I bought the 13 inch version to display music sheets and the control app for my digital mixer. I appreciate the split screen option that allows me to run two apps side by side.I bought a 3d party magnetic folio cover and a non-Apple stylus/pen. They work well and are much cheaper than the Apple versions. The default iOS apps are annoying and restrict my ability to fully use the tablet the way I want but the apps I downloaded from the App Store work pretty well.,4,iPad Air 13inch M2
P. Meyer,7/10/2024,"This replaces a 2019 10.2” iPad basic model that has started lagging pretty bad with every new update that Apple releases. I probably should have stopped taking them before ver 17.This unit is blazing fast. It is everything in my tiny off grid cabin, tv, web browser, ssh terminal, and though none of these uses are very cpu intensive the difference between the old and new is stark. This thing blazes.I certainly would not have bought it if Apple hadn’t crippled my old one with the newer updates. This is a thing that cannot be avoided - the axiom is ‘nothing makes old computers go faster than old software’.I was disappointed that my lighting accessories for reading usb thumb drives do not work with this unit regardless of what adapter I tried, you have to buy new ones. The good news is the cheap one ($15) I bought works fine.For TV I use the hdhomerun app with their dvr, the bigger picture is welcome on this display and the contrast looks better but the image is no sharper. The makers of hdhomerun change the ui constantly but the underlying interface to the tuners and dvr seemingly hasn’t changed in years, considering the number of crashes and bugs that remain unresolved, so I didn’t expect much of an improvement.",5,iPad Air 13inch M2

Jonathan Ham,7/13/2024,"I waited a while before I wrote a review on this because I wanted to test it out and I’d say it’s been a few months now and so far everything is great. I had the old iPad Air 11 inch model before the M1 chip and I could say the upgrade to the 13 inch M2 iPad Air is pretty good. It’s a lot faster, and I can play any of my games on a bigger screen and the battery life is amazing. I didn’t realize how much of an upgrade it was going to be until I started using it, but but it does run faster and it has great battery life a substantial amount more than the 11 inch that I use, definitely worth it. The screen is the same. The speakers are a lot better. It is USb c I got the 256 GB model and it’s more than enough space to play Clash of Clans ANOTHER EDEN AFK Arena Marvel heroes and many other games. It runs Genshin great I can play call of duty on it and it’s a real workhorse. I hope this helps anyone who wants to buy it but I love it.

My old IPad continue to work so for a very small cost I now have two IPAD.  I did have to give up face recognition on the air however the finger print option on the air work great.  Very easy to set up by putting my old IPad next to the new air and it did all the work by copying everything from my old to the air.  Just wish it would give me an indication it was moving data for it took about 30 minutes with no indication anything was happening.,5,iPad Air 13inch M2
jill w,9/11/2024,Beautiful iPad works flawlessly. I thought my old iPad was still fine until I saw this one. Wow.

J. Garrison,10/31/2024,"While the device itself may be OK, the process of setup and transferring data from another device is an exercise in hair-pulling rage-inducing frustration.  Apple seems to delight in writing software that goes into funky states that can take hours to return, without any user feedback or ability to interrupt.During the setup process it forces an OS update (18 to 18.1) which: (a) spends 20 minutes in ""Preparing Update"" with no feedback or estimated completion time; (b) If you aren't babysitting it, it then stops and does not install the update until you return and press the ""Update"" button, even though you already did that before; (c) The update itself seems to hang and never complete; I eventually gave up and rebooted the iPad, which did manage to bypass the update; (c) then it goes into data transfer mode, and never provides an estimate completion time, just sits forever on ""Estimating..."".As a career software developer I'm dismayed and appalled at Apple's software quality.Update: I found the only way to accomplish the transfer was to (1) do a full LOCAL (not iCloud) backup of my old iPad in iTunes on my PC; (2) Set up the new iPad as a new device; (3) Update the new iPad to the latest iOS (18.1); and (4) Restore from the backup using iTunes.  This worked flawlessly and quickly, with no hangs or extremely long pauses stuck on ""Updating..."" or ""Estimating..."".",2,iPad Air 13inch M2

Steven M. Mcmahon,9/21/2024,"In contrast to my usual practice of upgrading my iPad Pro two years later, I made an exception due to a close friend borrowing my previous iPad Pro model from 2021. Unfortunately, he dropped or let it fall off the couch, resulting in a cracked screen.Since I was out of warranty, I quickly realized that replacing the screen would be quite costly. Consequently, I decided to gift the iPad to my friend and purchase a new one instead. Typically, I opt for the iPad Pro with the highest memory and cellular data options. However, my carrier, T-Mobile, was only offering a deal on an iPad at the time. They would have applied the credit to any iPad product in the past, but this time, they refused. Therefore, I saved a significant amount of money by purchasing the iPad from Amazon, which already takes a percentage off the top. This was the most favorable deal available for an Apple product.To further reduce expenses, I opted for an iPad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity. Given that I already subscribe to Premium iCloud services, it made no sense to pay for the highest level of memory.In summary, I made a wise decision by purchasing the iPad at a reasonable price. The iPad itself features several improvements, including the M4 processor, a thinner design, and upgraded cameras. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.While I typically purchase my iPad Pro through my carrier, which comes with a subsidy, I am retired now and occasionally consider commuting and traveling. However, my travel frequency is limited, and I can easily connect to Wi-Fi at home, restaurants, or other establishments.Logically, I was able to save a substantial amount of money by purchasing the Premium Apple product and opting for the iPad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity. I am very pleased with my decision.Although I could have potentially saved even more money by purchasing the subsidized iPad nine, I would have ended up paying more due to the monthly fee.In conclusion, if you decide to purchase an iPad, it is essential to get the Magic Keyboard case and the Apple Pencil Pro, as they complement the product and enhance its functionality.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

James Harris,6/30/2024,"As a solutions architect who frequently works from home and on the go, having a reliable and high-performance device is crucial. The Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) has proven to be an outstanding choice, offering unparalleled power, versatility, and features that meet all my professional and personal needs.First and foremost, the Ultra Retina XDR display is nothing short of stunning. The 13-inch screen provides crystal-clear visuals with exceptional brightness, contrast, and color accuracy. Whether I am working on complex projects, watching videos, or browsing the web, the display delivers an immersive and vibrant experience.The iPad Pro's 512GB storage capacity is more than sufficient for all my apps, documents, and media files. While local storage is ample, most of my media files are stored in iCloud or OneDrive, so local storage wasn’t as important to me.The cameras on this iPad are top-notch. The 12MP front and back cameras produce high-quality images and videos, making it ideal for virtual meetings, document scanning, and capturing moments on the go. I use it all the time for online meetings, and nobody can tell the difference between this and a high-end camera in my home office setup. The addition of the LiDAR Scanner is a game-changer for augmented reality applications, providing precise depth-sensing capabilities that could potentially be useful for professional tasks, although I don't use it for creative tasks.Connectivity is seamless with Wi-Fi 6E, offering faster and more reliable internet speeds. This has significantly improved my productivity, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted online sessions, whether I am attending virtual meetings or collaborating on projects.Face ID is another excellent feature, providing quick and secure access to the device. It works flawlessly, adding a layer of convenience and security to my daily routine.The all-day battery life is impressive, allowing me to work, browse, and stream without constantly worrying about recharging. This feature is particularly beneficial for long workdays and travel.The iPad Pro's performance is unparalleled, thanks to the M4 chip. It handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking and running demanding applications to high-end gaming and content creation. The device is incredibly responsive and powerful, making it a true powerhouse in the tablet market. Despite packing such high performance, the iPad Pro is super thin compared to its predecessors and remarkably light, enhancing its portability without sacrificing power.To complement my iPad Pro, I also got the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro. The Magic Keyboard provides an exceptional typing experience and includes a built-in trackpad, enhancing the iPad's functionality and making it a versatile tool for work and play. The Apple Pencil Pro is perfect for taking notes, drawing, and navigating the iPad with precision.However, one minor drawback is the cost. While the iPad Pro offers exceptional features and performance, it comes at a premium price. Nonetheless, considering the quality and capabilities of the device, it is a worthwhile investment for professionals and power users.In summary, the Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) is an exceptional device that delivers top-tier performance, stunning visuals, and advanced features. With its Ultra Retina XDR display, 512GB storage, high-quality cameras, LiDAR Scanner, Wi-Fi 6E, Face ID, and all-day battery life, it is the ultimate powerhouse for anyone looking to maximize their productivity and creativity. Paired with the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro, it offers an unmatched user experience. Highly recommended for professionals and tech enthusiasts alike!",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

Frank Maresca,12/25/2024,"I have only had this iPad for almost a week and I paid a little bit under 1200 for this iPad and it was well worth the money for the 256 GB I still have an option to purchase AppleCare they give you 60 days which I am not going to be purchasing. The last iPad I had was the iPad Pro first generation 12.9 inch. which is still like brand new besides the battery which I had replaced for $100 and that was well worth the money, but it was time for me to upgrade and don’t get me wrong. I still use my first generation for certain things, but when it comes to speed performance, obviously this is by far superior. It’s not even close, but the iPad first generation only goes up to iOS 16, so it’s a matter of time before I’m not able to play certain games. I am very happy with this purchase.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
Major [DJTR],1/8/2025,I am an artist who has been tied to Apple for so long. I remember the iPad 1 and how it was not quite enough to fill the position it has now been able to with this new iPad Pro M4 and the Apple Pencil Pro. The price is higher and worth it for anyone who has digital art and design experience and needs. The coprocessor is just as powerful as the best iPhone and the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately) has a great capacity for drawing and sketching on the screen without some accessories that at best are not making use of screen illustrations. I am not sure why this pencil still doesn’t have the ability to swipe and maneuver within the iPad itself. But when you want to create and have a massive amount of real tools and a real brush feel: the pencil becomes a genius tool. So I still use a stylus and pencil for total control. But if you have wanted an iPad or have been uncertain about this new 2024 iPad Pro 13” amazing machine.. pay the extra and find peace,5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
p heaton,12/23/2024,My current iPad is probably 10 years old and still working but I broke down and bought the Apple iPad Pro based on my daughter's recommendation. First thing that happened was the new one recognized my iPhone 13 that was nearby and automatically installed all the settings from my iPhone. So setup was a breeze! I did not buy the pencil or the keyboard but I probably will soon. The display on this iPad is noticeably better than my old iPad. The one problem I'm having is that the unit is so thin and light it is awkward to hold it steady and use it without it slipping out of my hands. I've ordered a case/stand to use with it which should help. Apple should probably include a case in the box. Otherwise I love this new model and hope it lasts 10 years like my old one.,4,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

D & G,8/21/2024,"Over all it works great.  Beautiful color..The cons I have are with Icloud.  I hate this future.  I just want to use the storage on my iPad but you can not.  The problem with this icloud is it is so difficult to delete stuff from it once it is there.  So if it gets full and your email won't work anymore because the cloud is full of pictures and stuff.  You end up buying more storage.  It is a scam.  But there is a place to stop storing pic at least.  Just know to turn it off right at the start.  You can not turn it off completely because some programs need it somehow to work.The other con is some of the programs that come with the iPad.  Are just not user-friendly.  You can not do tasks like rename or even name a file.  There are a few other small things that should be there.  It is like the developers never used there own product so they don't know what it is missing...Location is another problem.  You need it on for some things to work right.  Like London time.  But other places you do not want location on.  It is a game to find all the spots to turn things on and off.  And in the end, you are not sure you caught it all..The last con I have is you can not use your iPad to get any apps free or not.  Without giving them a visa # they store it for you.  I don't like to store visa cards online.  But they force you to.  I would prefer to just pay when I buy something.",4,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I promise you will either b laughing by the end or scratching ur head trying to figure out hw I did it! I drive to work and had a meeting and was looking for my iPad all day! Then drive all the way back home to look wasn’t there went back to work went to the class room I was teaching in and it wasn’t there but when I got back on the freeway with heavy disappointment and thought maybe someone had stolen it or would turn it in tomorrow it was like a 💡 went off in my head! I recalled leaving for work and thought I had hit the trunk button to open the trunk because I had started to drive and it sounded like I’d hit the button well it wasn’t the trunk button it was my iPad rolling off the top of my car! But my boyfriend says “ no way why wld u leave ur iPad on top of the car?” As we are coming down the Main Street I tell him ( I made him drive me after the 2nd drive back!🤭) “ thts where I thought I had popped the trunk open!” He sprints out the car runs across the busy street to see if it’s there! And oh boy was it there n a million pieces! As I see him running back I started to cry 🥹and he says “ babe keep driving I think it’s still missing a piece!” I couldn’t believe it! My 2 year old iPad was gone! So immediately I jumped on Amazon and bought this and I’m still getting use to it because it’s so thin but bigger than my old one but honestly this one feels and looks smaller than my other one idk why but it does but I still love it👌🏾,5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

I just want to add some personal / real user input.Just upgraded to the 13 inch M4 1Tb from a 1’st gen 11 inch Pro. GET THE 13 inch ‼️The extra screen size is amazing; it’s NOT too big. BRIGHT, yes ‼️ You can dial it up to “wow”. If you only use you iPad inside at night you will never need this level, BUT if you take it outside where the ambient light level is 30x brighter, you will still be able to use it. “Too much processing power” …. RIDICULOUS statement from short sighted critics. Next year or 2 years from now you will regret not getting the fastest processor available. I’m loving it NOW. I was slackjawed when I saw how fast it did video editing. You only buy old tech when you plan on living in the past.Battery life is excellent just like I expected. Fast response just like I expected. My photo library looks amazing ‼️It looked good before, and everything looks even better now; sharper, brighter, and more saturated. It’s like seeing all of these photos again but for the first time. Is it expensive; yes. It’s clearly a semi-luxury item but as an item that typically sees 2 - 4 hours of use per day for both personal and work purposes, it’s actually a bargain for the convenience.VERY SATISFIED",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

I was hesitant about buying the pro over the air given the size was identical and the screen didn’t look much different from each other. However, these two are miles apart if you’re trying to justify the price difference, I can help you out.The oled screen on the new iPad Pro M4 13 inch looks amazing, coupled with 120 Hz display makes it feel like 10 years in the future, I compared the sound quality of both the iPad Air and the iPad Pro 13 inch and again these are both miles apart. You can definitely tell although the iPad Air has good sound quality it’s only coming from two speakers the iPad Pro, M4 13 inch corporate four speakers the iPad Pro M4 also is thinner believe it or not over the iPad Air by no means do I think this is a dealbreaker, but it’s definitely worth mentioning. I didn’t notice the battery.

Diego Alejandro Naranjo Zapata,6/16/2024,"I just change my iPad Pro second gen to this one, i was so excited about the product but right now i have an issue with the new apple pencil pro, this one has a problems, it disconnects from the ipad by itself, sometimes it doesn’t draw, the battery is sooo bad, on my first one was more than a week, this one gets dry in one day, a little bit more but ok… So, it seems like all the issues with the pen solves by resetting the ipad to factory settings, for me is so bad because i am already late with 3 illustrations i have to finish and I can’t do that now, so, disappointed with the product because it started having issues and supposedly on a product of this value is so bad to start like this…",4,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
Mylum Chesley,7/11/2024,"About a year ago the 50"" TV in my bedroom died, so I started using an older iPad I had gotten free with my iPhone 12 purchase (some promotion they had going) as what I would watch ""TV"" on via streaming services. The issue is the old iPad is small and didn't have that great of picture, so it was past due time to upgrade.When i received the new iPad Pro 13"" it seemed massive in comparison but ultra thin. The first show I watched on it in bed was mind blowing how amazing it looked; the new OLED panel is hands down incredible. I have it attached to an arm that is mounted to my bed backboard. At the distance I have it from my face when laying down, it's like having a 75""+ screen in front of me with crystal clear clarity and vibrant colors. The sound is 200% louder and clearer than my old iPad and the battery power is very good. I haven't utilized this anywhere close to it's max potential, but I'm impressed with what I have used it for so far.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

Jose S.|Jose S.,6/16/2024,"First of all, it seems like an incredible device, sublime design, powerful and usable, but I expected more, specially after the last Apple software conference.There has been a lot of talk about it having too much power for its software and it is true, it shows.  It needs a big upgrade so you can justify paying that much money for it.  But of course, its performance is sublime in everything it does, the Pencil Pro works perfectly and I find it an essential accessory. If you are an iPad user, know what it is and want one, go ahead, you won't be disappointed.  But be clear if you are going to get the most out of it or a cheaper one such as an AIR may be enough.",4,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

Derek,7/20/2024,"The new iPad Pro is an excellent device. The reduced thickness at first seems unnecessary but after holding it for a while this becomes a welcome enhancement. The device feels solid despite the thinner design. It works well as expected and battery life is at least as good as any prior version. The OLED display offer excellent image quality and a wide range of brightness levels. I appreciate having the toggle switch to limit charging to 80%. The space black finish matches my MacBook Pro exactly. The Apple Pencil Hover feature is a nice addition that allows you to see where you’re pointing before tapping (the mouse pointer follows the pencil tip in Sidecar mode, too).The center back of the device can get uncomfortably hot under some scenarios, such as working with layer masks in Adobe Fresco. I’m guessing this is an app bug as the iPad never gets hot, or even warm, at other times.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

Megan Abrams,10/15/2024,It was time to upgrade my wife's iPad so we went big. This generation is an improvement in all areas. The new screen is beautiful and colors are vibrant. Even though we went with a bigger size then last generation this one weighs less and is thinner front to back. Transferring files is super easy if you follow the instruction from apple.,5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
