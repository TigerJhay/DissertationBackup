1/22/2025,The iPad was a great purchase. I bought it on Black Friday weekend for a great price. It was very nice to buy a 256 gigabyte. I had a 32 gig.,5,iPad 9th Gen

1/18/2025,this is Ipad is cheap for a reason,3,iPad 9th Gen
1/18/2025,When we purchased this product not even the Black Friday sale could come within $50 of the price which made this one a no brainer but we are happy with this choice and have enjoyed watching our son learn and grow on this one. Charges easy and screen time seems like days but in reality I place ours on charge every other night with at least 30 to 50% battery life left after probably 3 hours of screen time (yes educational) and just being turned on. We are using this for multiple apps for school and learning to read. Watching him use this better than I do might be concerning lol.,5,iPad 9th Gen

1/16/2025,"Seems ok enuff. Just failing to understand how a 4 year battery life on a 2021 model is a steal in 2025. Many moons since 1st grade but correct me if im wrong 2021. 2,3,4,5 hummm 2025. Fact checkers show me how flawed my logic is in comments.",3,iPad 9th Gen
1/16/2025,"Don't buy apple products from Amazon. One, more chances it might turn out to be defective (Mine had a scree flickering and its operating way slower), second Amazon will no hold on to their return policy. The customer service will always find different ways to end your chat or cancel your return. All you will hear from them is ""Sorry for the inconvenience caused"" and ""That's my limitation and anything else, I have to end this chat or call"". If you keep pursuing they will politely say ""You will get the same information with anyone you call to"", sarcastically nothing you can do. They won't respect their own return agreement on their website. Utter disgrace.I talked to 5 Customer Service agent, 1 Service Specialist and 2 Technical Customer Specialist. Most of them are rude not pointing to the right place or person for information.",1,iPad 9th Gen

1/14/2025,"I got the Apple iPad (9th Generation) for my four-year-old, and it’s been amazing! Everything runs smoothly, and the 10.2-inch Retina Display is perfect for games, videos, and learning apps. The 64GB storage is more than enough for all his apps and some downloads for offline use.What I love most is how easy Apple makes it to manage access with Apple Family. Setting time limits and restricting apps is a breeze, so I don’t have to worry about him spending too much time on the screen or stumbling across something inappropriate.One tip: make sure you get a great case to go with it, especially for kids. It’s worth it for the extra protection against drops and bumps!Highly recommend this iPad for families—it’s a great mix of performance, usability, and security for little ones!",5,iPad 9th Gen

1/13/2025,"Maybe after four years since its launch, the processor doesn’t perform well for some games. However, for studying, watching videos, and similar tasks, it works very well. Its connectivity is also great.",4,iPad 9th Gen
1/13/2025,Seller no problem. iPad another story. After hours trying to set up and then reset to factory I may be sending back.,3,iPad 9th Gen
1/13/2025,The display quality is excellent. There are no issues with connectivity. It’s a good weight and I think the screen is the perfect size for taking on an airplane. Anything bigger and you just start to get too big to carry around. I have the 256GB and I’m glad I got it because the system will run better with more memory to access. If you can pick this up for a couple hundred bucks you won’t be disappointed. Good luck!,5,iPad 9th Gen

1/7/2025,"When I was researching what new iPad I was going to get, I came across this one by this seller.  I viewed the photos and all on the same page was an image for powerful performance, the all day battery, the 12MP ultra wide front camera along with the smart keyboard and apple pencil  It turns out it did not come with the keyboard or pencil.  Yes, it probably stated what was in the box, but I was focused on the photos.The delivery was awful.  It was marked as 'handed directly to a resident' which was absolutely inaccurate and untrue ---- the box was laying beyond our driveway (which is about 50 feet from our front door) in the road!  This was the most disappointing experience and that it was noted as 'handed directly to a resident' is dishonest.",1,iPad 9th Gen

1/1/2025,"If you are looking for something that gets the work done but is in your budget, it is the to go. The black color provides a premium look. The Durability is just amazing. I have been using it for a job and it looks new. It doesn’t compromise on the  functionality. I have a wifi Connectivity iPad which is just enough since i am mostly connected to the wifi. I would say, for 300$, this has been a life saver. Either for college, multimedia or reading, a real value for money from Apple.",5,iPad 9th Gen

12/25/2024,"Ordered as a Christmas gift and as we opened it this morning, there was no factory shrink wrap.  Then, while setting up the Ipad, it prompted us to erase all data as the Ipad was already partially set up.  I didn’t think anything of it until the screen started to fail within 5 minutes of using it.  This was not listed as used or refurbished so we are very upset.",1,iPad 9th Gen

12/24/2024,We bought two of these iPads for our kids for Christmas. They came very visibly refurbished. The white boxes were not wrapped in plastic but instead were taped shut at the edges. The iPads were in plastic bags inside the box. The charger and block were filthy and scratched. We paid full price for what we thought were brand new iPads only to receive two used ones. Returning immediately.,1,iPad 9th Gen
12/24/2024,This is an amazing iPad got for best deal. I’m loving it,5,iPad 9th Gen
12/24/2024,"Bought this to try out since a lot of my peers use iPads. Even though this version is dated, it more than gets the job done. Pair it with a knockoff pencil and it is unbeatable. The screen isn't the best for a pen, so get one of the knockoff paper-screens too. The 64 GB feels a bit small, but as long as you are smart with your file usage (ex: deleting old files), 64 gb is plenty.",5,iPad 9th Gen

12/21/2024,"Great Ipad overall just make sure its placed in a case with a screen protector. i had it for a week and barely dropped it resulting in a cracked screen, my fault i know but just a warning. it does run Ipad OS which is a huge plus compared to IOS in the older models. so this ipad is still current with the newer models in my own opinion and it does have cellular connectivity so it can be helpful for business use or for the kids on road trips.",4,iPad 9th Gen
12/20/2024,"I am absolutely impressed at how long this is able to stream on a single charge.I have insomnia and often stream shows and fall asleep with the iPad on.  I also live where we get a lot of power outages in bad weather so I run downloaded shows while the power is out.I put the display on close to the lowest brightness level to make the battery last, and it ran all night, 9 hours and used only 50% of the battery!So if you need a tablet that has an amazing battery that will last a long time on a charge, this is it!",5,iPad 9th Gen

9/15/2024,"Bigger and heavier than the iPad Mini's I've owned, from the first generation to the 5th generation.After a few drops of my 5th gen iPad Mini, its display started giltching. I've had it from its release day to present. So it's been a few years. I was going to upgrade to the 6th gen Mini next, but being sixty-ish...... things are harder to see, so I decided a bigger, more productive iPad would be the better buy.This iPad Air M2 11"" is awesome! So many upgrades and definitely a more productive tablet! Reading at night is so much easier. Using a keyboard and typing up reports and ideas is so much better. Gaming is so satisfying and it's just the second day of owning this tablet!The journey from the very first iPad Mini to 3rd and 5th generation to this, just astounds me! And to think it all started with a Kindle for reading.I highly recommend the iPad Air M2 11"" and may, in a few years, upgrade to an iPad Pro in the future!",5,iPad Air 11inch M2
10/24/2024,"I recently purchased a new IPad Air M2 to upgrade from a generation 5 IPad.  So far, it has been a seamless experience.  I am still using the older IPad for a second screen or for listening to music or streaming, but the new IPad has pretty much taken over the du ties of my MacBook Pro too!  I purchased an Apple Pencil for work and it has worked out pretty well so far.  It is nice being able to write again.  My fingers were getting tired of the typing motion so it will be nice to switch between the two mediums.  I highly recommend the new IPad Air 11 inch M2.  It makes me feel all grown up and super productive!  : )",5,iPad Air 11inch M2
11/24/2024,"I own a regular iPad and a 13” IPad Pro.  The iPad Air is replacing my regular iPad.  The reason for replacing my regular iPad is that my iPad is old, the battery does not hold a charge as long as I would like and the touch screen was getting inconsistent to my touch.  The iPad was slowly dying and I chose to get a deal with Black Friday as opposed to waiting for the device to fail completely.You might ask why I didn’t just use my iPad Pro.  The reason is simple: the iPad Pro is bigger and heavier and I added the Magic Keyboard, which while a nice keyboard is heavy.  I found myself using my regular iPad because it was just lighter and more easily portable.  I still use the iPad Pro, but I just don’t like walking around with it.  For light use, the bigger screen just doesn’t matter that much to me.I went for the iPad Air primarily because the device was on sale for $100 off and the base Air has more storage than the regular iPad.  Also, instead of getting a Magic Keyboard, I got a Logitech combo case and keyboard that is much lighter.  This is an iPad I want to walk around with.  In retrospect, I question the use case for the iPad Pro.  At that size and weight (including the Magic Keyboard), I’d just get a Mac.Other than that, the Air is a regular iPad with more memory for most people.  It seems to work just like my old iPad, just shiny, new and a bit faster.  Biggest different is that the finger print scanner is on the side of the Air, which is nicer and the screen is nicer.  But there are no “day and night” differences.It works the way it should.  Seems to connect better than my old iPad.  I also got a better case this time.  The old one was more bulky and connected via Bluetooth and there were always delays in connecting with the iPad.  The new case is designed for the Air, connects the same way as the Magic Keyboard and does not need to be separately charged.  All the things that irritated me about my old iPad are now gone and I am now a “happy camper.”  As for anyone who has a working iPad, I cannot tell you that you will see much difference from your old iPad.  Aside from the issues with my old iPad, I would not have made this purchase.  The improvements in the iPad are just too incremental to recommend upgrading for the sake of upgrading.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2

1/12/2025,"I purchased a two 11""  iPad Airs, one 128MB and one 256 MB. I also purchased the iPen to replace an older generation iPad and pen as I was always running out of storage space on the old one. My primary for upgrading is that I have transitioned much of my workflow, journaling, and note taking to a digital format,, so I wanted something that I could use as a portable notebook, planner, etc.PROS: I love that it has so much more storage and a stronger processor so it easily flows between apps witout lagging. The display is also much sharper than my old mode. I also love that my iPen can now charge just by being magnetically attached to the ipad itself without having to plug it in.CONS: The only real issue I have had with this new device is that even though I primarily purchased this device for journaling and notetaking, the device gets hot across the top when using notetaking apps, specifically Good Notes. Upon googling this, it appears this is a known issue with these devices. I'm hoping that it is something that can be fixed with a software update.Overall, I really do love the new device and it would get 5 stars if they fix the heat issue while using Good Notes.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
1/6/2025,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. This is her 3rd Ipad. I'm an Android guy (Samsung) so I can't say too much. I transferred the data from her old one and it was reasonably painless. It's a lot faster than her old one esp. Wi-Fi since it is a 6e product. She uses it constantly.,5,iPad Air 11inch M2
11/4/2024,"While I love my new iPad Air, I did have a problem with the file transfer from my iPad 2018 to the iPad Air 2024. The QuickStart file transfer seemed to be going well until the new iPad Air wanted to update to iOS 18 during this process.It did not give me the option to opt out so I started the download. It seemed to download OK, but then did not give me the option to install later or install now. The only option it gave was to install. I hit install and that began my problem. It ran for an hour and a half and still did not complete the install and though I gave it more time, it still did not finish the process.I googled the problem online and found out that this was an issue which could only be resolved by stopping the process. I turned off the iPad Air and when I restarted it I had to reset it and then check for updates. Then gave me an option to update to 17.7.1 or iOS 18. I chose the former as that was the iOS system on my old iPad. I then tried the QuickStart program again, and it worked flawlessly.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
7/23/2024,"So for years I have been wanting Apple to make a tablet that is a perfect replacement for my Macbook Air. This to me is exactly that. With the keyboard and case, this is essentially an 11"" laptop with a removable touchscreen screen. A dream come true in a lot of ways for artists, writers, and teachers like myself. One warning though, it ONLY works with the new Apple Pencil Pro and the Apple Pencil (USB-C). It does NOT work with the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) that worked on the previous iPad Air 4th and 5th gen.I send this as a warning because I have the iPad mini (6th gen) and Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) and they work brilliantly together for what I need. When I got this new iPad Air M2 The Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) was not working on it. It was not securely connecting magnetically where it should and it was not registering on the iPad M2 when I did get it to slightly connect. I thought it was the iPad Air M2 that was busted but after a call with Apple themselves this morning it was cleared up. Late last night in my panic and frustration with buying a new device that seemed to be defective I began the process of a return. Amazon does not offer exchanged on this product. This morning though when I called Apple I was told that the description on the apple site says ""Supports Apple Pencil Pro. Supports Apple Pencil (USB‑C)"" and I figured it would work with the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) as well but it does not. Return was canceled and I ordered the Apple Pencil pro.So if you, like me, have the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) and it works on previous models of iPads perfectly and it charges perfectly and it does NOT work this new model iPad Air M2, you're not crazy and your new iPad is not broken, you just need either the Apple Pencil Pro or the Apple Pencil (USB-C).It is still an amazing device. Truly spectacular for what I need. I love love love it for sure, don't get me wrong. Apple just makes this stupid decisions and I want to reach out and people know they might need to get yet another apple device to use with this new apple device. I assume a LOT of people are going to be getting this iPad Air M2 model to replace their previous iPad air 4th or 5th generation model. Logic would say that the previous amazing top of the line apple pencil that worked on the previous models iPad Air would work on the new M2 model. Nope. Just a heads up. 5 stars because the device is still incredible -1 star because Apple is a pain in the arse at times.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
11/17/2024,"Amazon had the 5th gen Ipad air on sale a couple of months ago, and given how fast the M1 chip was, I thought it'd be fast enough, but it wasn't.  very strange.  the 5th gen also had another issue, the base unit only comes with 64GB, which makes it obsolete right after you buy it, or you'd have to spend +100 to get the 256GB.  The 6th gen M2 was perfect, the M2 processor proved noticeably faster even in everyday tasks, although the CPU itself isn't much faster, but I guess add the extra and faster GPU cores, and NPU for Apple intelligence, and at 128GB, which is all that I needed, ended up being the same as the gen 5 256G variant.

12/1/2024,"This is my very first brand new iPad and I love it. The tablet is the solid quality I expect from Apple, and the storage will be fine for me as I don’t have a lot of apps on it yet. It does come loaded with a full suite of apple apps, which is a great way to get started. I was able to use my iPhone to set it up and it only took me a few minutes. The bright and large screen is much easier on my eyes than my iPhone. It is a bit heavier than I expected once I put it in my case, but I don’t mind because of the size and protective quality of the case.

10/22/2024,"I was in the market for a smaller iPad, I previously had a 13 inch iPad Pro but found that it was actually TOO big for what I used it for. I was excited when I saw Apple announce the new iPad Mini 7th Generation. but when I looked at the actual specs, it was actually really disappointing.And then I started looking into the iPad Air 11-inch with M2 chip. For an extra 50 dollars compared to the $499 price tag for the new Mini, I get a much better chip (M2 vs. A17), a slightly bigger screen, a landscape positioned front facing camera for video calls, and overall just a more powerful machine.Let's face it, unless you are a video editor or use your iPad as your computer replacement, a M2 chip is WAYYYY more powerful than what your average user uses their iPad for. I mainly use it to consume entertainment, fire off iMessages with my friends, watch YouTube, surf the web, or play a few games, and the iPad Air M2 does all of this seamlessly. And the 11 inch form factor is perfect when you are lying in bed or traveling.At $550 (the current price on Amazon, and what I paid for) the Air is an absolute no brainer and should be future proof for a good 3-5 years.Buy the iPad Air with confidence!",5,iPad Air 11inch M2

When I draw on a wacom I feel like it's my actual line. I think the smoothing on the Ipad can be adjusted in procreate further, but the cintiq comes out of the box that way. Yes, in terms of being able to work without cords; it is hands down, hard to beat right now.If you want the line you're trying to draw to be what you want, I don't think it's quite there yet. I try to draw the same line on top of each other and it's never quite the exact line I'm trying to draw. I want to be able to draw using just pressure to get the line width I'm expecting. I'm sure others who have worked with the Ipad longer know the settings to get what they want, but still right now it doesn't compare to a cintiq. I will stick to my cintiq for my professional work and I hope eventually the ipad gets better.

6/7/2024,"I bought the iPad Air to replace a 2018 iPad Pro which had some earned honorable battle scars, dents, and scratches, but was valiantly chugging along with an aging battery.  I was surprised that for my daily use I could see no detectable differences in display or speed.  I was especially surprised that an obsidian display of some 8000 notes  took about the same time to form on each machine.  I have not timed it, but then I am concerned with perception and not numbers.  A imperceptible difference is not a difference.The two machines are now my constant companions.  I use one while the other charges and the major difference is the color of their cover.  Instead of a replacement I feel I purchased a younger, companionable, clone.I am satisfied with my purchase.  The combination of Apple tablet, watch, and phone continues to be unsurpassed, though I have replaced my MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with a Linux laptop.I am undecided about the new Apple Pencil. My second generation pencil does not work with the air, but a no-name pencil I purchased from Amazon in 2022 works intermittently.  I can usually get it to work again by closing and reopening the program I am using.  The pencil is still on sale for $9.99 but I will probably purchase the $15.99 model with fast charge and palm rejection before considering the generation 3 pencil.I am a college full professor and use these devices primarily for research, writing, preparing and delivering classes, and general office functions.  Number crunching is done on the laptop.",4,iPad Air 11inch M2
9/16/2024,Time for me to replace my aging Apple products this year.  My 2019 iPad still works but I really underestimated the amount of storage I needed.  32GB was fine for my first iPad in 2014 but very inadequate for today's demands.  It was becoming pretty useless and I was unable to update the software without having to make more storage available.  So instead I bought one of the new iPad Airs.  I contemplated the Pro model but decided to also update my 12 year old MacBook so decided to go with the Air 11 in model -- really a fine product.  Great speed and screen resolution is superb.  I use it every day reading the news with my coffee.  I opted for Apple Care + as well -- through iPad settings.  I guess next up is a replacement for my iPhone11.,5,iPad Air 11inch M2

7/13/2024,"I had an IPad years ago, and while a nice tablet, it frustrated me how difficult it was to load music and videos on it from my PC.  I stayed away for a long time, but thought I'd give Apple one more try.  Apple has totally fixed that irritation since then, as file transfers are much easier in Itunes with this tablet and PC.  Another thing that kept me away from Apple was the lack of expandable storage (micro SD slot) in every phone and tablet.  An SD slot should always be included on any tablet over $300, but the lack of one makes you upgrade sooner, whuch is a garbage move by Apple.  Combined with Apple's ridiculous premium $ they charged for higher storage capacity, I just stayed away.  With this latest tablet, Apple finally charged a somewhat fair price for 256GB in storage, so I bought it.  Gotta say, I love it now.  ITunes works easily with my PC.  Plenty of storage at 256GB.  Nice and bright screen.  Fingerprint ID button placement seems a little odd, but you get used to it quickly.  It works every time.  Long battery life.  Includes fantastic M2 chip, which pretty much destroys every Android tablet chip.  All in all, a ery nice tablet.  Now Apple, about that micro SD slot......",5,iPad Air 11inch M2

I'd say actually purchase the iPad and stop flirting with the competition. It's great, I know the price tag be steep but once you have it, it's the immediate go-to. I've wasted so much time hassling other tablets to remotely have it feel natural and apple has it done, in the bag.

Another thing is that it heats up sometimes, I've read it's an issue that should be fixed with an update, and it's usually fixed after restarting it or leaving it alone for a while, so that part is annoying.Apart from that, I love it and I think this is the best option I could have purchased with my budget!",4,iPad Air 11inch M2

I reached out to the company and they gave great advice and help me, so big shout out to them. I enjoy my phone and had it for a full month now. There’s no complications and it’s a great iPhone.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
12/30/2024,"It was time for Mimi to get a new phone as her Iphone X was starting to give her problems. As everyone knows now, if Mimi is not happy, only grandkids are happy. Mimi needs long battery life and storage for more photos and videos.The camera is awesome and easy to take great pics with Mimi now acting more like Ansel adams. Low-light shots? Perfectly detailed. Portrait mode? Like having a professional photographer in your pocket.The battery easily lasts a full day, even with Mimi use. Now, she has very few apps in her life and in the past her battery drain was the biggest issue. That is now corrected and Mimi is happy.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

1/9/2025,"I always buy my phones and this was my first purchase of a refurbished phone. For all I can tell the phone is brand new and was easy to set up. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars not 5 is because the charger and cord that came with it are not compatible with the iPhone i bought, but on a good note it does work with my iPad. I had to go out and purchase a compatible charger and cord for the iPhone.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
1/12/2025,"Had a little trouble transferring to eSIM, but it ended up all working out. There was a minor cosmetic issue on the bottom right corner where the aluminum had been dented, but other than that I am satisfied. Much cheaper and than buying even Apple Refurbished, and the worst case scenario is that you get a dud and return it with Amazon's forgiving return policy.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
1/20/2025,I wish they would care to say why they would mail an iphone to me with the box all nasty as this.Very disappointed.. although the phone it's self is fine the packaging is NOT.,4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
1/11/2025,"The phone got delievered quicker than expected, the quality of the phone was great! I just did not like how scratched up the screen was so I will probably pay to get it replaced. Other than that I would definitely buy another phone from this company",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

11/25/2024,"Phone was as listed, however they do not come with chargers that work with Apple products. The seller does respond quickly, however after my second charger from them not working on any of my Apple products, I’ve come to the conclusion that they just don’t offer chargers that are compatible with my phone. Just make sure you have a charger ready to go for your new phone, and you’ll have no problems. Over all, I suppose I can’t complain too much, I got a good phone for not a huge hit on my bank account. I’d still purchase from them in the future.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
1/14/2025,First time getting a renewed device and have 0 regrets. Aside from some minor scuffs on the phone it's nothing too jarring. Can't really complain about it either since it came with 100% battery health. Overall well worth the money.,5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

12/13/2024,"This is the 3rd time I’ve bought a used phone off of Amazon but the first time buying from this seller, and I’m not disappointed! The phone was in great condition, came with a charger, and had a great battery life. Phones go down in value so quickly, so I just can’t stomach paying full price for a brand new one when a used one like this works perfectly! This phone was for my friend, and he loves it.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
1/13/2025,it’s a great refurbished like new phoneMy only complaint is that it wasn’t a smooth transfer of service I had to contact Amazon live chat twice. I had to contact Apple twice and I had to contact TMOBILE twice and then a third time I had to drive over to T-Mobile to actually transfer my service for my iPhone 6 SE to my iPhone 15. I am currently pretty happy with the iPhone 15 sometimes the screen Gets frozen not sure if that’s because I have to keep updating the iOS. I guess Apple phones are all the same. I’ve never had an android so I have no idea how to compare it but so far the photos are much clearer and work much better.,3,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
11/27/2024,"He tenido la oportunidad de comprar artículos en Amazon Renewed y acerté con esta compra no solo fue uno sino no 2 y les puedo decir que llegaron en calidad de nuevos las baterías ambos tenían solo un ciclo de carga ambos sin ningún problema estético, solo los cargadores no vienen los originales pero eso para mi no es ningún problema ya que aquí Amazon tiene muchísimos y de muy buen a calidad. Les recomiendo este vendedor ya que sus productos vienen bien inspeccionados y con calidad 100% garantizada",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

10/16/2024,"The packaging and shipment handling not up to par for price collected. Much less Amazon! No original box or packaging,  ""how to use"" booklet, and charge cord was very worn. The protective phone packaging for normal, much less abusive handling was scant...it stated it was ""refurbished"" so I was expecting to receive a much more professional presentation. Looked like a teenager put it in a small box with an old ""C-cord"" and mailed it. Next buyer beware....",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

Este estaba en estado ""Excelente"" asi que no deberia ser perceptible a 30cm. La verdad es que le he puesto un protector de pantalla y solo es perceptible si esta la pantalla en negro y te fijas, sino no se ve nada.En la parte trasera tambien tiene una que parece mas sucio que rayado pero con una funda tampoco se nota tanto.",4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

10/14/2024,The cycle count is a bit higher than wanted and the maximum capacity is a bit low. I didn't expect a brand new phone but still was hoping for at least maximum capacity of 100%. Great color but a few searches and the battery does seem to die kind of faster than expected. For the price not too bad.,4,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

11/14/2024,I use this phone everyday no issues!! I know buying a phone off Amazon seems sketchy but they come in great condition doesn’t heat up and it’s not slow either!! Much cheaper option then Apple for the same like brand new product!! If ur thinking about it just do it!! No regrets!!!,5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"
10/20/2024,"So far everything works very smoothly, battery is fine, no serious chips just a tiny tiny dent on the back. Only thing is the screen was obviously what was replaced because it’s very warped, but it doesn’t effect the actual display or touch so unless that would bother you it’s a non issue. another thing, if you get the 15 DO NOT do the data transfer on set up then update, the update will not install. either set it up without or do icloud, then do the update from the settings, then do your data transfer, i promise it will actually save you time in the long run",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

11/21/2024,"Hi,The quality of this product was great. For sure it was like brand new.But the issue was when attempting to connect it to my cell carriers network, we were unable to connect it successfully. Our carrier said that the phone was reported lost or stolen by its previous carrier, t-mobile, so therefore it could not be used.Sucks to say the least because it was a present for someone. Hopefully no one else encounters this issue.I will be returning it and expecting a refund for it.",3,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

6/12/2024,"Upgraded from my iPhone 11 that was suffering due to poor battery health after many years of use. Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

    I purchased two renewed iPhone 15 devices (128GB), both in flawless condition—100% battery health, no scratches, and under Apple warranty until September 2025. Performance on both phones is exceptional, everything was butterysmooth, 2day shipping and well packaged. Although I was initially hesitant about DirectCertified due to mixed reviews, their prompt customer service reassured me. Overall, an excellent purchase and great value for both devices!",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

After researching renewed options from different sites this option came up as the best priced for the best quality. I’ve bought renewed items before from others sellers / companies and have had issues, so I was a little nervous. When the phone arrived I was shocked at the quality. It looked brand new. No scratches or any issues at all. I will never buy a brand new phone again when I can buy it for half the price for the same quality. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE / PRODUCT",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

I researched and decided I got the best bang for my buck if I went for the iPhone 15 rather than the iPhone 13. The quality of the unlocked refurbished phone is outstanding. It's just like new except for the packaging. I especially appreciate the much longer battery life as my previous phone I had to recharge constantly during the day. On this one the battery lasts all day. I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera often but it seems there are a few nice options on there. The extra black space at the top of the phone shows any extra application you may be using in tandem with what's on the face of the phone. This is really handy, for example, if you're using the Google navigation and go away from that to check your messages.",5,"iPhone 15, 128GB"

The battery charged to 100%, showed 6 cycles and there were no bumps, bruises or knots that indicated hard use or wear and tear—just a barely noticeable nick on the screen. . Transferring data from my 11Pro to the 15 was fast and easy. The only challenge I experienced was installing the ESim card and my carrier helped with that.  So far, I haven’t experienced problems with the applications I use most often.  My tablet and watch connected easily and I have twice the capacity of my old phone.

6/6/2024,"I love my Kindles, I've had several of them since they first came out.  Still use the latest version daily but I needed either an iPad or a true Android device to run a couple of specific Aps.  Couldn't get the aps to work properly on a ""google play cracked"" Kindle, didn't want to spend $500 on an iPad.  Ordered this Lenovo based on reviews, research and recommendations.  Exactly what I needed/wanted!  Fast, light, cheap - couldn't ask for anything more.  Came with a pretty good case but I upgraded to a ""child proof"" case since I use the tablet to do field recordings and carry it with me most of the day.  Wanted to downsize from my current 11-inch Kindle and this is as small as I will ever go but the display is large enough with great color/resolution.  Battery life seems to be fantastic, I use it to occasionally browse or check email or weather, but mostly to capture data transmissions via Bluetooth and I go 3-4 days before having to recharge it..Picture is of the tablet atop my Kindle and work iPad and then laptop.  Super light, small enough to slip in a jacket pocket.  Haven't found a single thing to complain about in the 3 month's I've owned it.",5,Tab M9

3/1/2024,"I've used some sketchy tablets in my day. I did feel I could be gaining more experience with that when I picked this up on sale a few months ago. I've been quite pleasantly surprised.There are quite a few negative reviews out there. The storage space is tighter than I like, but honestly adding more applications and junk defeats its purpose. Other than that, I think reviewers are expecting $1,000 tablet performance and graphics. That's not what the tab m9 is. If they want that, they'll have to pay. Similarly, the camera is mediocre by today's standards, but I have a Pixel that has a fantastic camera. I don't need another. That's all I can think to say to knock it.I've watched movies, read stories, played logic games (nothing graphicly intense) although I don't really play computer games. Browsing the web and social media are pleasant experiences.I'm taking it travelling. I'll watch a movie or two on my flight. Resolution is great for the screen dimensions. I can VPN into work, use ssh, and get a shell on machines I manage if something comes up. It does everything I need and everything runs smoothly. I don't try to crush it, I just use it.Temper your expectations and enjoy this little tablet. It is a compromise tablet for the price point. I keep it updated, running android 13. It's a pretty good deal.",5,Tab M9

All I can say is that it will run Microsoft 365 just fine, plays media just fine, with some decent audio from the speakers, btw, and runs my laserpecker software without issue.It feels premium with its metal and glass design.  The screen is quite vivid.  Performance is snappy and meets my needs.If you're looking for a basic tablet that won't annoy you with terrible performance, picture, and sound, then this tablet will check all your boxes.Just don't expect it to be a high end gamer, and you're not going to be disappointed",5,Tab M9
9/30/2023,"I recently purchased a Lenovo tablet, and I wanted to share my experience with it. First and foremost, I want to clarify that my review is not directed at the seller; they did their job in delivering the product promptly. It's important to note that sellers have no control over the product itself.I decided on a Lenovo tablet because I was in need of a device for both personal and work use, and Lenovo has a reputation for producing quality PCs and laptops. I carefully examined the product specs on the Lenovo website, which indicated that the tablet had 32GB of storage, expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card.However, when the tablet arrived and I went through the standard setup process, including adding my Google account and performing necessary updates, I was shocked to discover that I only had 17GB of storage space remaining. This was before even installing the apps I had planned to use.I inserted a micro SD card and attempted to set it as expandable storage on top of the internal storage, but to my disappointment, the option was nowhere to be found in the settings. After some research on the Lenovo website, I learned that the storage expansion feature had been removed in the latest system update, rendering the micro SD card usable only for photo storage.This left me frustrated as it's nearly impossible to work with only 17GB of available storage on a tablet. The operating system and updates had already consumed nearly half of the 32GB the tablet originally came with. Consequently, I promptly requested a refund and opted to purchase a Samsung Galaxy Tab with 128GB of storage.In conclusion, if you're in the market for a tablet, I would strongly advise against considering this Lenovo tablet. The unexpected removal of the storage expansion feature was a major disappointment, and the limited storage capacity severely hindered its usability for my needs.",1,Tab M9
10/26/2023,"|The media could not be loaded.|So this is a nice little tablet, I will say the folio case it comes with is okay but I would not trust it to actually protect this thing, the screen protector it came with is straight garbage and came with no tools to ensure a good application I honestly would rather it not have come with a screen protector at all.As for performance, I got this mostly as a streaming tablet but also for a little emulation and I am happy to report if you want this for emulation it is a great value get it. It can play light ps2 and gamecube games easily like Luigi's Mansion, Mario Kart, and Monster Hunter All play fine, and every system before gamecube like dreamcast, psp, n64 will all work perfectly.For video streaming I was actually dissapointef which is why I will probably end up returning this. I always watch YouTube videos at 2x and this thing it depends on the video but I would say about 50% of videos if you turn on 2x speed it runs at literally like 15fps and looks horrible, yourube was my primary reason for buying this so it just does not make sense to keep it. Netflix, hulu, disney, all seem to work fine and it does not make much sense why youtube has this issue, but it does. Also whenever an ad plays on YouTube it exits full-screen for some reason which is super annoying. I added a video showing 2x video on YouTube. In this instance it looked just fine until an ad played, then after the ad the franerate dropped to this like 10 or 15fps and looks terrible",3,Tab M9

11/20/2023,"So after submitting 2 support tickets and one ""help me"" message from their app on the tablet, I finally got a response to the support ticket that they were sending a replacement ""part"". This ""part"" arrived and it was a new tablet. I wasn't sure a new tablet would fix this since it looked like a software problem, so I was skeptical. I moved everything to the new tablet and it IS actually working much better. I can run all of my apps, except the one solitaire app still gets killed by the tablet. But I found the same game by another developer and it works fine. So I can live with one app not working vs maybe 4 that weren't on my old tablet. Maybe there was indeed some glitch in the hardware somewhere.So I'm raising my rating for their willingness to send a new tablet, which fixed things to the point I can live with.****Original Review****Bought this tablet in June so I've had it 5 months. This tablet initially seemed great, especially for the money and the fact that finding a decent tablet in this size range is almost impossible. It was working great until it didn't. So now I have to give the tablet only 1 star. This is mainly for the software that Lenovo has installed and which you CANNOT see, uninstall or control. It happened after their latest update.The system has a built-in memory management app that you cannot see and cannot control. After the last update, this app has gone on steroids and is very aggressive. It will shut down apps while you are using them or sometimes even before they fully open. Yes, that's right. You click on the app, you see it starting, then boom, it is is gone. I'm not talking graphic-heavy gaming apps. I'm talking solitaire card games and match-3 games. If you google this, you will find many angry posts about this and Lenovo's responses have been the typical, ""well, it is a system app so you can't do anything about it...too bad so sad.""So some apps work and some don't. I've contacted Lenovo via their app on the tablet and twice via their warrant support website since my tablet is still under warranty.  ZERO RESPONSES.  Obviously, Lenovo has no intention of addressing this issue or even any warranty issues. So buy at your own risk cuz once you buy it, you are on your own.",4,Tab M9
8/23/2023,"So I got this tablet a little while ago and here are my first impressions.I found the Lenovo M9 at 9” to be comparable with the few small android budget tablets that I've worked with over the last few years.  With its 5:3 aspect ratio, this M9 tablet sits very nicely on my palm & its very comfortable to work with.The frame – is made of metal & edges are hardly noticeable. Overall it has a very modern look and feel.Display – with its 1340x800 resolution and 368 lux, the M9 has a comparatively bright display but it’s still kind of dark when taken outside.  Indoor, this tablet has a very good contrast ratio with strong bright colors.Performance – With its MediaTek Helios G80 I had no issues opening several apps & generally transition from one page to next was very smooth.  Surfing the web was also generally good but this 4 year old SoC (system on a chip) has its limitation especially when playing games (some games couldn’t be played at all).  The same goes for working with memory intensive apps like video or sound editing.Speakers – Sound quality was surprisingly good for such an inexpensive tablet.  The stereo speaker were decent but still there were hardly any bass but then again most people probably use its 3.5 mm (or Bluetooth) to play music with a nicer (more capable) earphone or headphone.The Camera - M9 comes with 2 MP front facing camera and an 8MP rear camera.  Frankly the cameras are good for only snap shots & video conferencing as photos taken by this tablet look mostly washed out and low light photos looked grainy.  The same thing is true when taking videos which is generally adequate in good lighting condition but it can’t cope with low light conditions.Battery – This tablet comes with a 5100 mAh battery which is good enough for watching movies at mid-brightness for about 5 hours (& while connected to WIFI).  However watching movies at maximum brightness will significantly cut it to about 3.5 hours.  That said, it can be fully charged with a 10 watt charger in about 3 hours.Lenovo Tab M9 is a good affordable tablet that is modern looking (I really like the metal body) and is a good compromise between bigger tablets & tiny ones that often don’t come with a lot of features.  I only wished that it also had a LTE build-in so that my kids could watch their shows in the car so to keep them occupied.",4,Tab M9

I am an Apple user usually, but this tablet was easy to use, has a beautiful screen, is light weight and functional. Connects to WiFi quickly without issues. The touch screen works perfect. It even came preloaded with some fun time suck game. I would say this tablet would even be user friendly for kids should your little one need a tablet.",5,Tab M9
11/27/2023,"I picked this up this past week during the Black Friday sale, so I haven't had much time to play around with it yet. It's a cheap tablet, so my expectations weren't high. It can be slow in some cases, sometimes taking a little bit to load up some of the larger (read: Google) apps, but it's nothing beyond what I expected. It can play what few mobile games I play just fine, and play local videos and stream just fine too. My OnePlus Nord N200 phone has similar specs, just with a smaller screen, and the speeds are comparable. Entirely usable outside of some unique cases.It probably won't be great as a drawing tablet, but I'll be giving it a try anyway once I manage to pick up a decent passive stylus. I'm only using it to learn basics, so I'm able to keep my expectations reasonable. (For the record, this tablet doesn't support any active stylus types other than regular old Bluetooth. I figure I'd wait on purchasing an active stylus until I can also purchase a good tablet/2-in-1 to use with it.)I have a lot of issues with some changes that were made to Android 12L/13, but that's not really an issue with Lenovo, and from my understanding, they actually waited until the Android 13 update to implement the Android 12L taskbar, so good on them for holding out until they were sure it wasn't going away. I'm not counting that against Lenovo here.But that brings up the other reason I got it. I'm experienced with installing custom ROMs, and name brands like this one tend to have good support for them. The Developer Options section in the Settings has the toggle to unlock the bootloader, so it should be relatively simple for custom ROMs to be made for it. It may only have 3GB of RAM, but so does my OnePlus Nord N200, and that has a ton of ROMs for it.Obviously, doing such a thing isn't for the inexperienced. But I'm not, and so while I can only afford a budget tablet, getting this over, say, a generic Blackview tablet that might have more RAM for the same price, is still the better option in the end due to the longer OS support length.",4,Tab M9

They're not for gaming are extensive streaming, but they're better than Amazon's stuff because at least they run Android properly.For my purposes, it's for reading the news, a bit of simple games from the Play store, managing my bills, and listening to music. Nothing more. Nothing less.So far this meets expectations and the included folio case was a nice plus. But the screen protector included? Total crap. I tried getting bubbles out for an hour and the thing was still disgusting looking. For my use, this spends 95% of its life on my nightstand so I doubt I'll care.

7/28/2023,"This review is for the Lenovo Tab M9. I noticed the reviews seem to combine both the M8 and M9. As far as the M9, I purchased the tablet during prime day for $109. For the price, you will not get a better tablet. Sure, Amazon fire tablets sometimes are cheaper, but do not offer full access to the google play store and performance. The M9 offers good performance for the price. Web browsing, and light multitasking with split screen is possible. Also, some light gaming is possible with the right settings. Of course, when compared to an iPad mini 6 (which I own) or a more expensive android tablet, the M9 will be beaten. However, I recommend the M9 if you need an entry level tablet with full access to the google play store. The screen is plenty bright and it has good built quality.As far as the included folio case, the magnets are not very strong, so it does not stay closed. Also the screen protector is plastic and flimsy. I ended up purchasing a glass tempered screen protector and am using the folio case until more are released with better form factors. Skip the M8, which is abysmally slow now and the screen is dim (I owned the third generation M8). Just be aware that the internal storage of the M9 is  limited, so if you have a lot of apps, you may use up a lot of storage quick. I use it mainly to stream YouTube, Netflix, etc and web browsing. I’ve also used it to video conference through zoom.",5,Tab M9

The included case is great quality for protection against scratches in your bag, ease of holding, and auto sleep when closed - but in no way is this going to save your tablet from a fall off the table.*This tablet is going to need a couple minutes booting to full speed when powering up. This isn't the case when waking form sleep mode - it's ready to go automatically. But expect some patience when cycling the power.*This tablet should be good for live android updates until at least next year, but runs great out of the box for the basics.*I've also dabbled with some low end retri emulation (GBA, SNES, and even PS1) - all working great especially when connected to power.

Also I wanted to be able to check my email and surf the web a bit. Well, there's so little space you can't install mail apps. And even offline in battery saver mode the board game I downloaded crashes the tablet. I think there isn't enough memory. It was cheap and I didn't expect a lot but it is worthless.

If had researched Lenovo tablets before my purchase, I wpuld have found out that I couldn't transfer apps to my SIM card; and I wouldn't have bought it, because it has only 32 GB.

This 9"" is just right in terms of size, for me.  The screen isn't quite as crisp as I'd like for reading, but it's still better than many other tablets I've had.  That is my first complaint, the second is that  I can't format a new 128G micro SD as internal storage, only as ""portable storage.""  (Lenovo's help and specifications are insanely nonspecific at times.)Those are my only complaints and overall this is  the best tablet I've had in a long time.  The case is great, mine came with a little folding cover (can't promise they all do), which is VERY useful and effective though it's just plain plastic.  My apps run very well, not too much proprietary idiotware added to the OS as far as I can tell, and all the controls and functions are fine.Overall this tablet gets a very solid ""A"" and just misses an ""A-plus.""

Again, put it in perspective of the class it's in.I definitely would buy this again. As a matter of fact, this is my 2nd Lenovo tablet because the first one I purchased a few years ago is still great -  but using for a different purpose, so I needed another, so I turned to this smaller one.",5,Tab M9
11/11/2023,"There is a lot to like about this tablet. It's nearly the perfect size to use as a reader and for general entertainment. It feels solid and is suitably fast for general infotainment functions. Some reviewers have even reported being able to use it for light gaming. I would not expect it to perform as well for multitasking/productivity type functionality. This was going to be my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for an inexpensive but functional tablet for the next year or two. I was also ready to get one for a family member who is not especially tech savvy when, out of the blue, the tablet offered an Android 13 upgrade. Wow! So soon after procuring this tablet. Nice! Well, as it turns out, Lenovo's implementation of Android 13 on this device includes a completely pointless taskbar. This taskbar is great at getting in the way and provides little additional value when you are using this tablet as... a tablet. It might have some use if you were using this tablet for a productivity device - but this is not a tablet that is especially fit for productivity apps. This taskbar severely impedes using navigation buttons and cannot be hidden when using them. So, if you want the taskbar out of the way, you must use the default launcher and set navigation for gestures. Only once this is done, may you use a third party launcher. You can then swipe down to make the taskbar disappear. It will reappear after restarting the tablet or after unlocking. Then this workaround must be done again. Other manufacturers allow users to disable the taskbar in the interface. Lenovo's Android 13 implementation for this tablet does not allow this. I am hoping this option becomes available in a future update. But, until then, I can't recommend this tablet for anyone who might easily be confused by this new ""feature"" - and it's a regular annoyance for me, too. It's too bad. Because otherwise, this is a very nice tablet for the price point. I'll circle back and note if this issue gets resolved with a future update.",2,Tab M9

I tried this one out and it was everything I was hoping for… everything but one major flaw.On the good side it was fast, smooth, great picture quality. It connected fine to all my other devices and it is, in my opinion, the perfect size for a tablet.Unfortunately I did not know that android tablets have started to go the apple route and do not allow you to increase your device storage space. You can mount an SD for extra storage, but not to increase the devices internal storage. This means that you cannot put apps on the SD and with the newer android OS being close to 15gig on it’s own and the files it creates upon starting your storage space is already half gone. That is not sustainable and I’ll be sending it back. It’s very frustrating because aside from that it’s a perfect little tablet for me. Sad day…",3,Tab M9

This Lenovo Tab M9 has finally offered me at bare minimum an equivalent of the HD+ with a much more advanced hardware and software system and noticeably lighter! No issue adding my e-book reader app of choice (eReader Prestigio) and also the Kindle app. Could not be more pleased with its performance, ease of use, and dependability. Would like to have seen longer battery life but with Wi-Fi off and in Airplane mode, it is sufficient. As for any/all of its other tablet uses, I cannot comment.

I literally have to go through every app and delete the cache or it will become glitchy. I am not a heavy user so this is pretty annoying. I either scroll FB or play ONE game.

I have a Samsung phone with Android 13 which still shows the pull down menu, so it appears to be this tablet and not Android 13.

1/29/2024,"I'm replacing another (older) Lenovo tablet with this one after breaking the screen on the other. I was very happy with that tablet, so I thought this would be a safe choice. Definitely a mistake.The tablet has an infuriating problem with breaking browser windows by reloading them if I switch away to another app and come back. This causes lots of problems if you have entered information previously or are using a progressive web app. There's not enough memory on the device to handle keeping inactive apps in memory. Normally that's an uncommon thing, but with this tablet it happens every time I'm browsing. Makes doing any kind of forms submission just about impossible unless you never leave the window. That dropped my rating from 4 stars to 2. (The other lost star was battery life}.The form factor is nice, the 9 inch screen is definitely a good size for reading books. The battery life isn't great, I end up charging it daily to be sure I have enough power for the next day. And there is an annoying Lenovo ""Duraspeed app restrict"" application which appears to be a watchdog to slow or lock background apps down if they use too much processor. Again, this feels like a kludge because the tablet is underpowered.Bottom line: at this price you can do better. It's not worth the headache.",2,Tab M9

11/21/2024,"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old and let me tell you why and how I came to this one:My husband gave my toddler his old Android Galaxy tablet a year ago and it has since died. It was a very old tablet but did what we needed it to do. When it died, I found an Amazon fire kids tablet, which was not what I expected at all and though there being lots of things for kids, there was very little parental control I actually had and we could not download the apps we wanted as it's all through Amazon.I then ordered an android kids tablet and I had it set to return within a few hours of opening it because of similar issues. We could download the apps we wanted but they were different- youtube kids for example. It did not allow us the option to log in to the account we already had and would not allow us the option to show only approved content. It was preloaded with ""teacher approved"" content for the age range. It had complete brain cells killing trash on it. I would block one channel and 5 more would pop up. The layout and format of the android kids tablet was also very different from the regular android tablets as well.It was at this point that I landed on this Galaxy Samsung tablet and I am SO happy with this purchase! It is everything we need and were looking for! The size is perfect, the picture quality is great, set up was a breeze, it connected to wifi and Bluetooth headphones easily and quickly and the sound is great too! It has a fast speed and it all works great. It doesn't get hot and it doesn't ever freeze! The price is super reasonable too, especially for what you are getting.Bonus to this tablet and what makes it great for my son is that I can hide all the apps and basically everything on the tablet that I don't want my son messing with. I can make it to where the ONLY things he can get into or have access to are the hand selected apps of my choosing. I was able to log into kids youtube and log in with the same login we have on our TV and other devices so that saved time and allowed for my son to only see the content that I approved for him to watch. I was able to download a bunch of the completely free and add free learning apps (lucas and friends) and he can have the fun of screen time all while it being all learning- ABCs, numbers, learning how to spell, how to write, easy math, puzzles, etc.I wish I could go back in time and start with this tablet instead of wasting my time with the other two I tried out.  If anything happens to this one, I will definitely be buying again and recommending this tablet to my SIL for my nephew.  I can also use this for myself as well.I bought the following kid proof case and it fits this tablet like a glove and will help protect it from my 4 year old dropping it.  It has the front screen protector on it as well which will help shield the tablet from getting wet too if spilled on.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLYCJZTH?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

10/23/2024,"I had a 9 inch before but it was slow and laggy. I decided to get a better one and found this. I was not sure if the screen would be too large for me. What I found is I personally love it. It is absolutely awesome for both on road and off road navigation. I loved being able to see way down my route and it was nice and fast so finding the next gas or food stop to add to my route was a breeze. I also really like that you can split the screen three ways and when doing so all my apps worked well.I do not like in dash screen headunits so I purposely bought an old style with buttons and knobs. So for me I was able to place the tablet low where it blocks most of the headunit so it does not block my view at all of the road. I stream exclusively so really all I need is my steering wheel controls. The 11 inch screen is big though and many, if not most, will probably not like it as much as I do. For me it was a dream.I do have a data plan and bought the one for my service. I have not had any issues. The sim card went right in and was working, giving me 5G service. I do always download offline maps for my trips and on my last one that took me way out and without service the GPS of the tablet was great and never once did it not know where we were. Made the trip a breeze.Personally, I prefer using a tablet like this instead of a in dash screen for a few reasons. First, I can take it with me. I can take if from vehicle to vehicle and then take it inside my tent, hotel room, house, etc. So, I have everything right there in one place. That brings me to my second reason of planning. I can have it with me anywhere and plan my route and trips right there. So if we stop to eat and I want to change some things and or check some things out I can easy and without having to sync anything or sitting in my vehicle. Third, I love that I can have it facing me. I hate how a in dash screen points straight back and prefer to have it facing me for the best view. This just works for me and I prefer it. I do use the tablet for other things like cruising the web, and it does that well too. My last one I mainly only used for nav and kept the app count low to try and keep it as quick as possible. That has not been an issue with this one and now watching a movie or show is much better on the much larger screen.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/22/2025,"Let me tell you a short story first. I'm 37 years old now, but back in 2016 I got a Galaxy Tab E for Christmas. I've been using that same tablet for years now. It's been reliable and continues to function, but it has awful performance, and apps are starting to freeze or crash. It's only gotten worse over time. It only had 12GB of space and 1GB of RAM. It's a shame, but it was time to put it to rest after a dutiful amount of use. I want to play mobile games, and it just wasn't cutting it. I also like to read books on Kindle, and my books were taking 4GB of the meager space on that old tablet. That poor tablet is now getting its much deserved permanent rest.Now fast forward to 2025. I just got this new tablet because of its excellent value. And I'm ASTOUNDED by it! It's surprising how much power you are getting here, along with the large bright screen. It can run 2D or 3D games really well, much better than you'd expect, but it depends on the game. 2D games are smooth as silk, such as my current favorite Dragon City. As for 3D games, Raid: Shadow Legends absolutely runs amazing even on ultra settings, and it's quite shocking to behold for such a cheap device, but that game isn't exactly the pinnacle of mobile graphics anymore, is it? Don't expect to run Zenless Zone Zero or other more visually intensive games which I play on my PC instead.The game performance for most games alone makes this tablet a surprising value. Yet it also has good battery life, charges quickly with most modern chargers, and has a stable operating system. I don't know if I'm just too used to using bad mobile devices, being mostly a PC gamer with a powerful gaming PC, but you really can't go wrong with the A9+ as a portable computer option!",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
12/21/2024,great tablet for the price. aside from battery issues the tablet is great to use . sound is good and and the screen is very good. Easy to navigate and uninstall apps you don't want. Highly recommeded.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/20/2025,"I ordered this to use for school. it works great, has a lot of space, the camera kinda sucks compared to a phone camera but I mostly just use it for note-taking.  I would recommend for school also getting a pen and keyboard because it helps alot but as far as if you just want to game this works great. I use it everyday. it does take a bit to charge. like hours but it does have a great screen life when it is charged. I use mine for school, games, and watching movies and it still works great even since I got it in August 2024 and it is now January 2025 so not too long but still works great.  will update of any issues arise",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
12/23/2024,"I really like this tablet. Everything works well. It is everything it is advertised to be. There are just two unadvertised things that cause me to give it 4 stars......Very nice. Very well made. Nice feel. I like it. But it is heavy. It is not possible for me to hold this tablet with a cover in my hands for long. I must lay them in my lap and get new glasses for that distance. But I am 81 so this might not be a problem for a younger stronger person. However, I would still give it 5 stars with this problem.The big problem is that the screen size is 11 inches. Microsoft does not allow its Android Office Suite to run for free on a tablet larger than 10.1 inches. They want $7 per month. Not going to happen. If I had known this I would have bought a 10 inch tablet. I cannot find a workaround. The only real options are to use Google Docs if you trust being online with Google, or WPS Office a free open source program. Just don't be fooled into subscribing to the paid pro version when you first open WPS. The only problem here is that when you first install it, it doesn't have the fonts you want and it tries to get you to pay for more font. Don't do it.  It is very easy to add True Type Fonts to the Fonts folder in Android 14.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/6/2025,"I bought this on a fairly tight budget to replace my fried 9th gen ipad. (Don't be like me and buy a cheap knockoff Chinese brand charging block!)First the pluses:- Great bang for the buck. For $199 you get a good, not great, fairly vibrant 11 inch screen, 128 gb memory, and importantly, 8 gb RAM.- It's thin, sleek and in my opinion, looks good.- Speakers are surprisingly loud- It has a headphone jack! Love that I can use my full sized Sennheiser wired headphones. One of my reasons for not going with the 10th gen iPad - no headphone jack.- Setup is a breeze with Samsung smart switch, was painlessly able to transfer what I wanted over from my phone.No cons, so far, but rather trade offs for getting an 11 inch Samsung tablet at this price:- Battery life is very average- it's only a 5000Mah battery and it shows - nowhere close to the battery life of my 9th gen iPad.- No fast charging - using an Anker Prime charger with a quality high speed cable, I could only get 10 watt charging.- Cameras are mediocre at best. If you're buying this for the cameras, don't.Overall, very happy so far. Will update if I run into any issues. Feel free to ask any questions.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/19/2025,"I bought this for my self to use as a media device when I'm out and about and I'll say that it does the job well for me. I primarily watch Netflix and YouTube and this does the job for me. Screen feels great, tablet feels good in the hand and the speakers are nice when pairs with dobly atmos. You get the nice over saturated Samsung colors but it works. In terms of a gaming device, I wouldn't recommend for that personally. I played public, cod mobile and TFT and man the graphic and performance in those games were pretty bad. If gaming is your niche, I'd spring for a more flagship tablet if you had the budget.  Overall a good tablet for media consumption.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/9/2025,"It was perfect, I tried to find one in a store to try out, but I couldn't... so I was a little nervous if it would fit my needs. I primarily use a small laptop for trips and travel but this is WAY better. Very fast, everything connected up perfectly. The initial setup walkthrough was flawless and I had my laptop replacement in under 10 minutes. The screen is bright and crisp. It quickly goes through my apps, I can split screen between emails and messaging platforms, and it's super convenient that I can just charge it off of any USB C connection. I paired it with a little portable carrying case and wireless keyboard and it's everything I need!",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
12/24/2024,"Setup was a huge headache.  Partly because I only got the 64gb version (plus 256GB microSD).  I did the samsung smart switch with my phone which got my apps and stuff over.  But then had to move a bunch of the apps from the internal storage to SD card.  After everything it is ok.  It is kind of slow...but I guess that is to be expected of a $150 tablet (faster definitely isn't worth the $800 extra for S10 tablet).Overall:  Pretty ok for the price, but I would advise to get the 128GB version.Update:  I just realized that the 128GB doesn't only have an extra 64GB of storage, the RAM goes from 4GB to 8GB which would help it a lot in responsiveness.  Had I realized the RAM difference, I would definitely have gone that route.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+

1/13/2025,"This is my first tablet and so far I am very pleased with it. I am 65+ so any type of technology can be intimidating to me but this was very easy to set up. I have a Samsung phone that I linked to the tablet and now I can play all my games, check email, access social media and search the internet with ease and no longer run my phone battery down. So glad I finally got this. I also bought an SD card to have extra memory if needed.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
12/13/2024,BE AWARE that the wall/ outlet charging adapter is not included with the tablet.  Only the USB C to USB C charging cord is included.  I am very disappointed that after receiving the Samsung A9+ tablet I realized that I had no way to charge it.  I don't own any Samsung products or other electrical components that require a USB C to USB C charger therefor I had to purchase the charger separately after the tablet was delivered.  Nowhere in the description on the Amazon or Samsung websites does it explain that you do not get the wall charger/ adapter with the tablet.  Amazon and Samsung need to make it very clear that you will not get the charger with this product ( probably other products also ).  Other than that I am very pleased with this tablet and it does everything that I need it to.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
12/6/2024,"I bought this during Black Friday deal so everyone knows.It comes pretty awesomely equipped however during the setup I was not able to skip the Google sign in which was rather annoying but I just logged in and all was good after that. I have had 0 issues with it, and I honestly I was extremely hesitant after reading somethings online about this device. However I did get it and its so far pretty great the preloads weren't completely over the top also which is nice. I have had 0 issues maintaining connection to wifi within my 1,625 sqft home and garage I do not have any as stated above. I use it for; streaming movies legally, browsing online, listening to music, connecting to my ring camera application, and journal voice memos which is why I am looking to get a quality keyboard case for it.**I will say you need to get a case specifically for this device do not buy anything that doesn't say Galaxy A9+ otherwise it will not fit more than likely I imagine is the same for keyboard heads up.**",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

1/12/2025,"This is mainly for those that own S line devices as myself - I own a Galaxy S24 Plus so when I felt a tablet would be handy and worth buying, I found this A9 + on sale!I expected more performance truth be told and that is not what you get here. The table it slow, felt lilke the speed of phones back in the early 2010s BUT if you put that aside, it works fantastic!",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/4/2025,"display(size and picture) + battery life are good. Performance is decent, kinda has a slow response time when tapping/doing any sort of task. (works for drawing + simple tasks like notes, movies, ect but I wouldn’t recommend it for any sort of gaming or heavy researching). Terrible charging speed. I plugged it in at 1% then worked a 8 hour shift and it only got to 60%. You also definitely cannot use it while it’s charging because it will die. But for the price I’d say it’s worth it for light/simple use.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/20/2025,"I have a total of 3 tablets in our house including a Tab S, A7, and now the Tab A9+. Overall, the A9+ isn't much better than the predecessors with one major exception, Samsung has finally figured out how to program the power button to both turn the tablet on, and off, without having to simultaneously press a volume button.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/4/2025,For 150.00 you would be hard pressed to beat it. I use it for entertainment and streaming and it's great. Runs YouTube TV and all the streaming apps. I'm really impressed with the speakers. Not your typical bargain tablet. If you are on the fence this is a good choice. Now it's not going to be comparable to the more expensive tablets. If you want to spend $500 or $600. But this is $150 and it's a really nice little tablet I'm totally satisfied.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
11/13/2024,"I've had several Samsung phone devices including more than a few of the Galaxy S lineup, and I'm a big fan of them. I needed a tablet I could sit in a stand for use as a portable/battery-powered extra TV for steaming YouTubeTV in the kitchen and out on the deck, and this really fits the bill. I intentionally got the model with the minimum specs (no need for terabytes of storage when used as a streaming TV), and it works perfectly fine for how I'm using it. And, honestly, the very limited way I'm using it essentially ignores all of the bells and whistles a Galaxy tablet comes with even in that baseline format. The Android platform is very familiar, and it and my phone devices can sync stuff (like display notifications of my text messages if I so choose), so that's a nice bonus. The sound quality is great, and I'm totally happy with the resolution. If there's any negative, it might be battery life. I'm only using it as a streaming TV, so who knows whether this application uses more battery that way or not. But even when I have it set with all the right battery saving settings, it does seem to run down the battery % a little faster per session than I'd expected. It could be because the screen brightness is tweaked up for TV viewing. But the recharge time is quick. Anyway, I'm not going to downgrade this product for something like that. It's a very good value IMHO. Mad props to Samsung for their Galaxy product lineup.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/15/2025,"Love my tablet it's a samsung! Just love the graphics and colors are so rich, interface is smooth and did I mention the battery lasts forever fast charging.I use my tablet mostly for games absolutely no problem with anything, customization of the tablet is great best of all the initial start up was a breeze. Highly recommend this for everyone and price was the cherry on top.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
12/31/2024,"I have had several off-brand tablets that were just OK, and I did not use them much. This A9+ with 8 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs storage boots up quickly, has good quad speakers and a bright screen with good battery life. As far as apps, many of them can be uninstalled which is good. Companies who sell tablets should not force app advertising on consumers. I see myself using it a lot more than previous tablets. With the discount, it was a good price point for what I got.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/15/2025,"I have had it for roughly two weeks.  The setup was easy and straight forward.  I use it for streaming live and prerecorded you tube videos, live twitch, and amazon movies.

So far, I'm impressed with this new tablet. The screen size is great, and the speed is more than sufficient for the price. It comes with a USB cable, which I believe is either a mini or micro USB on both ends. It would be more convenient if one end was a USB-A.  That’s my only complaint so far.

1/3/2025,"I bought this tablet exclusively so I could read manga and American comics, and the resolution and screen size is perfect for that. Be forewarned: this tablet does not come with a charger. It has the cord but no base. You'll need to order a Samsung compatible charger or it will charge unbearably slow. This is the only thing keeping this from being a 5-star product, in my estimation.",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/4/2025,I love it so far. It has a sleek design which I really love and a great size for streaming and games. I haven't set it up yet to rate performance but I will say it charges fast. It was at 55% when it came and in 15 min it was fully charged. It also has a USB cord to transfer files from one device to another.,4,Galaxy Tab A9+
10/16/2024,"I've been a computer user for many years (not an expert though) and I own a Samsung smart phone and laptop, so I'm not a novice to technology but I am for a tablet. It comes with a lot of bloatware, easily removed, and I was able to easily pair my phone settings to the tablet wirelessly - no problem. Haven't tried using the tablet as a phone yet but I probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside. So far I have enjoyed it, but I am disappointed that Samsung has sooooo many updates that consume a lot of time. I knew there would be a lot of updates when I first turned it on, but several days in I can still expect a Samsung update almost on a daily basis, and this is after I've done all the customizing that I want. Drives me nuts, so I encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to NOT do auto updates or you'll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something!  Do them on command or schedule them!  Samsung - get with it and bundle updates so they are less frequent, albeit more time consuming for each one. Other than that, apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good as are response times when moving from app to app or screen to screen. The battery life has been very good so far, and seems better than my cell phone. One thing I don't understand is why Samsung has offset the search bar on the home screen.....it is off center to the left on the screen no matter how I turn the device. Not a deal breaker but just looks very odd, if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen. The tablet is quite light, very thin, and the 10"" size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me. I especially like the touch keyboard that automatically displays with the Google search bar. Once I get past my learning curve, I'm sure I'll have more to say, but all in all, I'm mostly happy with the purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/12/2025,We got these tablets for our 8 and 9 year old boys to be able to do their online math curriculum. They were a bit challenging to set up being a mainly Apple household.

I bought one for my mother who is older and she finds it to be heavy, so, be alert to that.The sound is great through the speaker; I have not tried headphones yet. I use this tablet with a full tablet cover, which I would recommend, especially one with a kickstand. The tablet does not stand up on its own so a kickstand makes it much nicer for viewing videos or reading books.Samsungs are know for carrying a lot of bloatware that you cannot delete, like their own email app or their own browser app, etc. I found that this tablet came with very little bloatware that could not be removed; I am very pleased with that.",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

4/24/2024,"I got the 128 model on the Amazon sale a few days ago. The only reason I bought it was for traveling because I did not want to drag around my 2022 IPad Air and possibly lose, or mess up, a 500.00 tablet.So......like the headline states......it's OK for the price. Not the retail price, but the sale price. Last year I bought the Fire 11 for the same reason, travel, but ended up returning it after a few days due to a price drop and Amazon refusing to offer a price match discount. Along those lines...........I tried my best and spoke to numerous people over an 8 month period but Amazon refused to return or credit the 70 or so I received from trading in two cheaper Amazon tablets when I bought the 11. I have been informed, over and over again by Customer Service, you lose the trade-in on a return. Now, I cannot find this ANYWHERE in the trade-in policy. But there it is so be forewarned.I would say both the tablets are very similar, with a slight edge maybe to the Samsung with the 8GB vs 4GB on the Fire. Neither are as smooth as the Air, but that is where the price difference comes in. When I bought this I believe the Fire was 199 and the A9+ was 209. For an additional 4GB of memory 10 bucks is good for me. Plus, I had no more available trade-ins for the 20% discount.As for the tablet itself..... The sound is fine, picture is fine, and I really prefer Google Apps as they just seem to have more of what I want. I imagine build quality is similar. Now for the apps.......Prime video was loaded, along with Peacock, Disney, MGM, HBO/Max, Paramount......all my streaming services with one glaring, if not unexpected, exception. Apple+ TV. I found an ITunes app, but no TV app. Maybe the Fire has it, I don't know.I also loaded Samsung SmartSwitch which allowed me to sync info from my IPhone. No issues, worked well although it did take a minute using wireless connectivity.The tablet did not come with a plug as has been noted many times. I guess, you know, is it a big deal if you have other electronics? No. But if this was your only one.......I mean, really? Is that plug really saving all that much money off the list price? Some of these things the corporations do nowadays just seem silly/greedy.As far as charging goes, this seemed to be another hot topic. So, using an Apple 20W Fast Charger, the tablet went from 13% to 100% in about 2 1/2 hours. If I went USB-C only I would guess more than double that time would be required. I did make sure Fast Charge was on in the tablet.....it shipped that way.The battery did seem to wear down rather quickly, but not fast enough to return the tablet. The phone transfer was about 30 minutes, and all I did other than that was load Apps and change some settings for a few hours. This took me from 50 to 13%. How that compares to my Air, no idea. But it is acceptable.One thing I do not like.....and maybe I just need to try a bit harder.....I cannot figure out how to get Auto Blocker turned on. It's right there in Settings, but greyed out as is two other advanced settings below it. I just keep seeing a spiral up top right like something is trying to load. Only thing I can figure out is if you have free apps loaded you cannot block the pop-ups or whatever.Wi-Fi hooked up right away so I did not bother trying my phones Hot Spot. Other than that, I see no issues with this tablet. At the right price, of course!",4,Galaxy Tab A9+
1/3/2025,"I bought it as an Xmas gift for my kid, replacing his A7 that was not really keeping up with him. He really enjoys the larger screen and is happy overall with its improved performance over his previous tablet.  He is 4 so take this review with a grain of salt :-)",5,Galaxy Tab A9+

9/15/2024,"I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ Tablet, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its sleek design and the quality of its build. The 11-inch screen is a perfect size, offering a large enough display for all my needs without being cumbersome to carry around. The screen resolution is stunning, providing crisp and clear visuals that make watching videos, browsing the web, and reading e-books a pleasure.One of the standout features of this tablet is its quad speakers. The sound quality is phenomenal, with rich, deep bass and clear highs that make listening to music and watching movies an immersive experience. Whether I’m using it for entertainment or for video calls, the audio performance is top-notch. The speakers are strategically placed to ensure that the sound is evenly distributed, no matter how I hold the tablet.The performance of the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ is equally impressive. With 64GB of storage, I have plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and files. The tablet runs smoothly and efficiently, thanks to its powerful processor and ample RAM. Multitasking is a breeze, and I haven’t experienced any lag or slowdowns, even when running multiple apps simultaneously. The battery life is also excellent, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use.Another feature I appreciate is the user-friendly interface of the Android operating system. It’s intuitive and easy to navigate, with plenty of customization options to tailor the tablet to my preferences. The pre-installed apps are useful, and there are countless additional apps available for download from the Google Play Store. The tablet also supports a variety of accessories, such as keyboards and styluses, which enhance its functionality even further.In terms of connectivity, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ has everything I need. It connects seamlessly to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, and the signal strength is consistently strong. The tablet also has a USB-C port for fast charging and data transfer, which is incredibly convenient. The camera quality is decent for a tablet, allowing me to take clear photos and videos when needed.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ Tablet.

11/20/2024,"It's a good buy for the price, should've waited until blackfriday week to purchase but what the heck it's still worth the price.. I don't know why all the bad reviews but this tablet is simply beautiful.  Does what it says, and no the setup doesn't take that long but to sync your phone takes maybe 15 min, but the performance is ok, it lags a little when you keep adding more apps to it, durable, screen quality is 1080p, from what I see... overall, not a bad purchase, I just watch movies and Netflix on it and it's wifi and hotspot capable. I'm in the oilfield and it works fine with my hotspot.. works amazing on wifi at home.. again, I would buy another one, just with more gbytes though...",4,Galaxy Tab A9+

1/21/2025,I’m an apple guy but wanted an android device. Most budget android tablets are trash and run slow. This one one highest spec is less than the cheapest iPad and runs just as good. And now I get all the benefits of having android too. The interface is iPad like which makes it easy to switch to. Best tablet for the price!,5,Redmi Pad Pro WiFi
12/24/2024,"I wish the 11-in have the higher L1 Winevine certificate so I can watch TV shows and YouTube on 4K at 60 frames per second and HDR. The chipset on that tablet as the capabilities but for some strange reason the manufacturer then op for a better certificate for the capabilities to reflect the performance on the tablet. Now ask for for the bigger one the 12-in pro, it checks all the boxes at the 11th inch one didn't. Even though both of their speakers are very loud which I can't take away from the 11 inch and the value for the money is the same price as the 11-in. They both had actually screen quality in my opinion. And the color options are pretty cool. I barely watch TV now since I got this big boy.

Eu vim por indicação de avaliação de um canal do YT que assisti após comparar vários tablets pra comprar e indicou essa loja. O único ponto negativo até agora tem sido a falta da Nota Fiscal, mas aumentarei a nota assim que receber.Funções e Compatibilidade:BATERIA:Carregamento total em 1h30.No primeiro dia 20/09 eu usei bastante, por 12h, pra testar apps, jogos, tela, funções, tudo bom. Usei o dia todo pra testar recarregamento de bateria e deixei ir até 2% pra carregar.Ficou ligado 2 dias usando por 6 a 8h/dia em Modo Econômico de bateria e descarregou só até 60%, então gostei muito da bateria.- 15Out2024: bateria realmente boa. Joguei, assisti filmes, desenhei, li livros e a bateria durou quase 3 dias sem precisar carregar. Nunca deixe a bateria zerar pra carregar, quando estiver entre 3% e 5% recarregue, assim vai durar muitos anos. Faço isso com meus aparelhos e nunca dão problema com bateria. Peguei essa dica com técnico de informática e nunca mais tive problema de bateria viciada.BLUETOOTHEle aceita dupla tela no notebook, tv ou celular através do bluetooth.Consegui jogar nele com um joystick paralelo (marca Aolion) via bluetooth tranquilamente. Airbuds Xiaomi, Airbuds paralelo e fone de ouvido estofados com ANC ativo, todos via bluetooth deu tudo ok. Conecta tranquilamente com impressora, laptop, tv, teclado, joystick paralelo e com celular tbm Xiaomi. Não testei em outras marcas de celular.- 15Out2024: conecta bem com celular e tv da marca Samsung, pra fazer streaming de tela pra assistir vídeos. Mas não dá pra assistir em 4k, somente até 1024, mas foi ótimo.SOMA saída de som dele é boa mas achei que seria mais alta, tem entrada pra cabo de som tbm, muito bom, não perde qualidade. Fiz testes de som no Spotify, YouTube e Chrome, avaliando cada um com saída das caixinhas, pelo bluetooth e pelo cabo. Padrão de celular Xiaomi.Para assistir filmes ou ouvir músicas sem fone é bom, mas com fone é bem melhor a qualidade dos graves e volume no geral.TELAA tela realmente tem qualidade de imagem acima da média, imagem nítida com cores realistas. As paletas de cores ficam fidedignas. Boa para desenho, pintura e impressão. Eu comprei pela qualidade da tela, para uso de desenhos para Tattoo. Preciso de cores corretas para não errar tonalidade das tintas, e esse tablet realmente ajudou nisso.Quando usa o Modo Leitura 👁️, que corrige a coloração pra retirar a luz azul, fica muito bom pra ler livros e PDFs, facilita pra estudo sem forçar tanto os olhos. Pra ativar, só puxar pra baixo e ir no desenho do olho. Não esqueça de desativar para voltar a desenhar e ver as cores mais vivas novamente.-15Out2024: Para assistir filmes e YT, não sei ainda qual o motivo de não carregar 4k, só vai até 1024. Quando tento assistir em 4k, a tela fica branca. Eu devo ter perdido alguma informação no manual sobre ir ou não até 4K. Obtendo mais informações, eu trago aqui.ESCREVER, DESENHAR E TOUCHEscrever com dedo ou caneta com ponta de borracha/alumínio/plásticos (pen universal) dão na mesma, pois não têm rejeição de palma para estes.ATENÇÃO pra não gastar grana: NÃO é compatível com qualquer caneta stylus. Para ter rejeição de palma, a Xiaomi aprontou a brincadeira de criar uma caneta só pra esse tablet, e já fui atrás, o nome e ""Xiaomi Redmi Smart Pen"". Não gastem grana com uma Xiaomi Focus Pen pois ela só é compatível até a versão anterior desse pad, que seria o Redmi Pad SE, não serve pra essa versão Pad Pro. Fui atrás de várias rewiews, conversei com muitos vendedores de alguns países e fui ao site da Xiaomi do Brasil e Chinês. E só essa ""Xiaomi Redmi Smart Pen"" é compatível com rejeição de palma e conecta perfeitamente com traço sem falha. Fiz o pedido fora e assim que chegar, trago atualização aqui. Também fiz o pedido da POCO Pen (pois é a versão japonesa desse tablet, que o Japão comprou parte da fábrica lá).-09Out24: ainda aguardando as canetas chegarem, assim que chegarem, eu trago atualizações do que funciona. Quem tem pressa, como eu, tô usando uma canetinha universal dessas de 10 reais pra ir desenhando e escrevendo, só não esqueça de não encostar a mão pra não perder o traço.CAPA E TECLADOVi um pessoal falando lorota aí que não têm capa e teclado pra ele, mas tem sim! Basta buscar por ""Case Redimi Pad Pro 12.1"". Vão achar de couro, de plástico, de todo jeito, algumas até parecidas com capinha do Kindle.Ele conecta em teclado bluetooth também. Eu o conectei no teclado do meu iPad antigo e deu bom, mas só fiz pra teste. Há capinhas com teclado a venda aqui e em sites de outros países.  Eu pedi de fora tbm, assim que chegar posto atualizações. Comprei colorido com luz led bem frufru - já basta minha alma triste com o parcelamento desses boletos, deixa eu me divertir com os brilhinhos do teclado, a capinha de madame e aproveitar minha compra hehehe.-15Out2024: capinha com teclado chegou da China, não tem marca, abre em Flip, fecha desligando a tela. Tecladinho frufru bonitinho, conecta bem e ainda ganhei um mouse que tbm conecta. Vira quase um mini notebook. Achei firmeza pra estudos, pois cabe na minha bolsa. E da pra usar sem teclado tbm, só tirar, ele fica preso como um imã e lembra aquelas versões Samsung Galaxy Tab. Comprei com um desse de uma amiga, e parece demais. Enfim. Qualquer tecladinho (sem pendrive) funciona via bluetooth.NOTA FISCALAssim que o vendedor enviar a nota fiscal atualizo as estrelinhas aqui tambem.-9out24: nada de Nota Fiscal ainda. Vendedor tinha pedido 10 dias úteis. Cadê, minha nota, vendedor???-15Out2024... Cadê minha Nota Fiscal, vendedor? Já acionei a ouvidoria da Amazon. Ah nem, estou ficando estressada!Se gostou da avaliação, deixa like que sempre que compro, faço atualizações detalhadas de tempos em tempos. Eu volto pra avaliar uso de produtos a cada 2-3 meses por até 2 anos, falando a realidade do uso, se deu problema (e como resolvi). Podia ser pago mas faço isso só pq eu sofri muito indo atrás de produto e não achei avaliações assim.Avaliação inicial em 25 Set 2024.|",5,Redmi Pad Pro WiFi

8/10/2024,"Hello, this is my first review on Amazon. This review comes courtesy of a longtime Samsung user. Included is a picture of my S9 FE+ 256GB next to my second S6 Tab Lite (I lost the first one ;( ) shot on a S20 FE 5G. I will be comparing to my S6 Tab Lite. I really like the S6 Lite. I got it for $200 at Walmart (for both S6's). For comparison, I was given a Nexus 7 back in 2012, which was also purchased for $200. The Nexus is now 12 yo, and barely works. Using the S6 has been awesome. It's only chugged during intensive moments in gaming, and it only froze for a second or two. With three times the RAM as the S6, I don't think I'll have any problems for a long time.nThe size of the S6 Tab Lite is a lot more manageable for me. I could use it (the S6) one handed if I was only really using one half of the screen. I definitely can't with this! That being said, as somebody who's working on an engineering undergrad degree, I found the screen of the S6 too small. This screen feels big enough to use on most days. And with 256 GB instead of 64 GB, I can have games and lots of notes.A few notes: the S9 pen is a bit thicker and has a smaller button than the S6 pen. Second, I was getting better rear photos on the S6 than the S9, I don't know why. I hope it's user error. I'll update you on that. Finally, the S6 feels slimmer in my hand even though they're the same thickness, thanks to the S6 having rounded corners versus the sharper/more upright edges on the S9.Conclusion: For relaxation, the S6 is better, assuming you're not playing hard-core games (it ran fine on Honkai ... on the lowest settings). For work, the extra real estate pays dividends and with a good keyboard case, should be good to replace the laptop most of the time.Proper Review:When I wrote this originally, I didn't have the Samsung portfolio case. I left a review there about a month ago. (Short and sweet: It's very expensive, but it's also perfectly suited to what I need from this device. Backlighting would be nice, but I don't find it to be as much of an issue as I did a month ago.) Update on the camera: I think I smudged up the camera when grabbing the first time. I took a picture of an outdoor scene, and although it wasn't sharp, it wasn't really fuzzy either. I haven't done a side-by-side comparrison with the S6 Lite though. I'll update this update if I determine that smudges weren't the cause of the picture quality deficit.I learned about more software features, like RAM+ and wireless mirroring. In options, it gives the ability for up to 8 GB of virtual RAM. However, I also noted that 4 GB of RAM+ was selected and turned on by default. When I turned it off, it still showed up as 12 GB. Hopefully, this means I can have 20 GB of RAM, although I can't possibly imagine I'd need that many. I've noticed that the tablet seems to use at minimum around 4-5 GB of RAM. Makes me wonder how the S6 Lite manages to run Honkai Star Rail. I've seemed to have more performance issues in games than the S6 on higher settings, but the battery life is much better. It feels like this will never die! The S6 could only do 3-4 hours of gaming, but this can do much more, I think atleast twice as much, maybe triple? This also has faster charging speeds. Let me demonstrate the battery life. I have 1hr 15 minute classes. With note-taking almost the entire time, this went down 7%. At that rate, that's probably almost 16 hours of on-screen time!This tablet really is something special, especially with the portfolio case. It's small enough that I feel comfortable walking a mile to class with this in my hands (in a 13' Macbook case lol), and it's big enough that I can get work done on it - as long as I'm not constantly switching tabs. Windows is better for rearranging tabs, although Samsung provides more freedom - I just don't find that freedom useful personally. I still stand by my opinion that gaming is easier on the smaller screen - I accidentally pressed the accelerator in RR3 numerous times on the S9 FE+, but that never happened on the S6 Lite.Anyways, that's it for me. I'd highly recommend getting the extra RAM, especially if you're like me who was raised to use stuff until it falls apart. If you're a student, I couldn't recommend this tablet more strongly.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
11/1/2024,"I absolutely love this brand's tablets. This is my second one. But probably the fourth tablet for my family to purchase. First one lasted almost three and a half years before I had trouble with it. Then another five before it gave up the ghost.I love the upgrade of the pen. This was my one big reason with go with another samsung over say a fire. And I was thrilled with how well this tablet handled my artwork.Since getting I've been on it a lot. I love the bigger screen (In comparison to my phone) The high speed under which it works.If I could change or improve this, I don't think I would. The pen was my main complaint in the past, but I am thrilled on how they included, and upgraded it and how smoothly it works.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
12/20/2024,"Like any mobile device from Samsung, this tablet is well built and will last a few years if not abused.I'm not over fond of the Samsung special apps loaded and I tend to squash any I can. This is one reason I wish I could get a Pixel tablet with the same features, I do not like bloat.Aside from the unneeded software, it's pleasing to use. Some things are different from my old Tab S-3, but it's quite a few years newer so that's expected.Of note, the included S-pen will magnetically attach to the back of your tablet. This is a nice feature but also I don't trust it to keep my pen in place. I purchased a case which takes advantage of the magnet but uses an elastic strap to ensure it stays where its supposed to be.The fingerprint reader is on the power button and I've found it both natural to use and accurate. You can adjust the navigation controls to be either a three button configuration or a gesture type. I prefer the three button. Unlike the S3, these buttons are not a part of the physical devie and instead are onscreen. This gives you the ability to both change the position of the buttons (mine are right of center) you can also change the order so the back button is on the left like most other Android devices. Oddly, I am so used to having my tablet with back button on the right instead of left that I just left it there.When I activated the mobile connection, Verizon downloaded an e-sim to it instead of using the included nano-sim. It also didn't activate immediately and I don't know why. Eventually I successfully activated it and conclude the range is just as good as my phone. I'm not 100% sure buying with the 5G mobile connection was wise, but that's a personal decision.Outside of the question of whether getting 5G was a good idea, there's no question this is a good product and worth buying.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
12/8/2024,If you are debating getting this tablet i suggest you dong and just get it! the battery life is so good it last up to two days. I use my tablet for college and for illustrations and it works like heaven. On top of this the features are so cool like veing able to use it as a computer or being able to use it as a second monitor. This feature definetly has been helpful as i work on my laptop and need noted open on the side. it’s also decently customizable bc you can change the pen cursor as you’d like. This definetly more worth it than an Ipad in comparison because you’re not spending another $100 for a pen.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
7/23/2024,"I bought this to make art and as soon as I touched the top of the S Pen to the screen I was blown away by how smooth and soft the feel is against the screen. Set up was quick and easy. It's even easier if you already have Google and Samsung accounts.It doesn't come with a charger block, only a type c to type c wire, which left me with no choice but to use a random off brand type c charger with a Samsung type A block which I hope won't mess with the battery or life span of this thing.The metallic lavender color is gorgeous and warm, quite similar to the pink HP Stream 14. The S Pen is a pastel, chalky lavender in a cooler tone.This tablet is razor thin, relatively lightweight for its size (perfect for drawing) and has a fantastic display.The user interface is typical of samsungs and androids. Unfortunately, Samsung phone themes are not compatible but you can customize the icons by selecting color schemes that match your wallpaper.Sounds quality is pretty good. It doesn't get too loud. To start, I played a mobile game and watched YouTube. Both experiences were hiccup-free and great on such a large, clear screen.The tablet comes with PENUP already on it, so artists who are just getting back into digital drawing will enjoy the app and its new, intuitive user interface.The S-pen has handwrite to text features that kick in automatically upon pairing with either your tablet or Samsung phone. I tried this S pen with both and the features come built into the pen!",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
12/10/2024,"Buying a new tablet is always hard. So many compromises to make since price is always an issue. I'm glad I picked the Tab 9 fe.Great color and faster than my older Tab.  This is my 4th Galaxy tablet, so I'm pretty comfortable in the Samsung universe. Even so, it takes a minute to learn the new features.Transferring from my old device was easy. Samsung walks you right through it.  A really Big Plus for me is the ability to mount a micro SD card. I added 256 gig. Gives me room.Charging is fast. Samsung doesn't include a wall wart, but I guess we all have a bunch. USB-C cable is Included.The S-Pen is new to me. The pen included is the 'dumb version so some advancedfeatures are not available.  An upgrade is available for purchase, if you want it.I'm not a Power User and this tablet is great for me.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
11/9/2024,"I absolutely enjoy my new tablet. Price was high, this said, prior to this one i got the Doogee, and had to immediately returned it back to amazon. So i went for the brand i know is reputable. And I did. It was so easy to set up. The style can do everything: draw, notation, and even highlight. Perfect for what i need it for.  The sound from the speaker are clear, love the wide screen. the images as sharp  love the graphics. I still have to learn how to use some of the apps i downloaded like the song book for my guitar. Now I take my guitar lessons on the road with me or any trips i have and never miss out on reading, or my guitar lessons. I also play games and movies. Perfect tablet for my needs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
1/19/2025,"If you install a photoshop for tablets, you'll get the most with images. Excellent tablet; however, if it is considered to design, try a bigger one to find it more confortable. The camera should be improved, however it's functionality is not to be used as camera. I strongly recommend it. Battery, translation, note taking, audio, video.. all excellent.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
1/6/2025,"My old Samsung tablet stopped receiving updates in 2019, so I figured it was time for a new one. After so much looking and comparing many brands and sizes, I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2023 in silver.Some of the layout and apps look similar to my old tablet, but many things have improved. The tablet seems fast, and charges fast (I purchased a fast Samsung charger separately). I like the fingerprint-scanning button (when the tablet is not locked). The S pen is responsive, even with a glass screen protector installed. I'm not into taking a lot of pictures, so the camera is fine for me. The sound is fine for me as well. since I just need the basics, nothing fancy, and I'm not a gamer.I got rid of some preinstalled apps, some that I was able to remove; others that I couldn't remove I disabled. I added some of my own apps, and added some music on an SD card. I like the note-taking app that was preinstalled.The Tab S9 is the right size for me to use as an e-book reader. I have a case with a hand strap, so I usually hold my tablet to read or check email. There are many things that can be customized on this tablet, including accessibility features. I'm liking this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
12/23/2024,"I just bought it on black Friday and I couldn't be happier about the purchase, the tablet feels very good, good quality, the Dex help mode is very useful, especially for people who need to have several apps open at once, the excellent multitasking. I haven't tried the battery as much but so far it's according to my needs, I have the 65W Samsung charger and I charge the tablet in 1h 30m, so I have no battery issues.Working with the S Pen is very comfortable, writing with it along, with palm rejection is very useful.I haven't tried it as much in games but having a common use have been very fluid the experience, The processor isn't high-end but so far I've done well in the games I've tried.What I like most is its integration with the Samsung ecosystem, I have an S22+ and passing files between devices is very easy, even to PC through Samsung Flow, the connection is very fast.For the use that the one wanted, which was basically for the University, it is really useful to take notes and work on Word or PowerPoint, even more if you add an inhalable keyboard with trackpad. Plus, it's great for watching media, with a good screen and great speakers.Being able to expand your memory using an SD card is something that is strange about today's phones and allows you to expand storage in a very easy way.I am a loyal Samsung user and I have not been disappointed with this Galaxy Tab S9 FE, if you are thinking of buying it, I recommend it.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
1/21/2025,"When I ordered this tablet, I was thinking it was pretty much the same size as most tablets my family owns and the one I was replacing, but it was a bit larger screen size. It is pretty close to the same weight as the one I was replacing, but has more memory and it works great. The stylus is so easy to use, and it attaches to the back of the tablet magnetically. I bought a case that has an open area for the stylus, with an elastic band to hold it securely, so I don't have to worry about losing the stylus, I am very pleased with this tablet overall.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
1/12/2025,"The Galaxy S9 FE+ tablet is much bigger than I initially expected, but it’s absolutely stunning. The premium design, paired with how thin and lightweight it feels, makes it a joy to use. It’s worth every penny, offering exceptional performance and the ability to multitask seamlessly, thanks to its split-screen functionality.The S Pen is a standout feature—responsive, precise, and perfect for note-taking or creative tasks. The camera quality is impressive for a tablet, and the sound output is nothing short of fantastic, providing an immersive media experience. Overall, this tablet combines beauty, power, and versatility in one sleek package. Highly recommend it!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

12/7/2024,"This purchase was for my wife for Christmas. She has previously owned two Samsung Tab As. This was a tremendous upgrade for her. She says that the operating system in almost identical to her S24 phone. My first complaint is that Samsung did not include a charging block with this device. Many of the charging blocks available on Amazon have less than stellar reviews. The buyer is left to their own devices to find the most appropriate charging block online or in a retail store. This is sad considering how many iterations of charging blocks manufacturers have gone through in the past 5 to 10 years. Another complaint is that the tab (and separately ordered accessories) arrived in a box with no cushioning material, literally clanging around but this is an Amazon problem and has nothing to do with the quality of the device.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

Also, the sound quality blew me away, especially considering that it's coming from a tablet.

Things that are important to me are storage, processing input, portability , durability, accessory compatibility, and  dual functionality.

I'm still learning how to get used to that. I'm able to have multiple screens open and split the screen to view them at once. This is incredibly important for me and what I bought the tablet for.

10/16/2023,"Updates will be posted on the top.Update #3 12/07/23My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0  Quick download and install no problems.Update #2 10/30/23I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow.  One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the ""strict power saving"" mode.  i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app.  So, I changed the power saving mode to ""optimizzed' and everything worked fine.Update #1 - 10/19/23.I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger.  It took 50 minutes.  The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.It came a day early.  The packaging was excellent.I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8.  I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9"" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger.  The battery was at 51%.  I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick.  I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8.  The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying.  it went pretty quick.All the apps except two copied.  One for some reason is not compatible with the S9.  The other I was able to install from Google Play.  After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps.  The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8.  At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem.  The extra .4"" in the display over the A8 is nice.  The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.I haven't tried any games since I don't play them.  I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.As far as the OS goes.  It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1.  However, the Android security update was Aug 1st.  I imagine it will update soon enough.  Google Play was June 2023.  It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.That is it for now.  I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.Another excellent product from Samsung.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

8/24/2024,"For a long time, I was strongly considering purchasing a new laptop computer.  I looked at and pondered over the many choices before finally deciding on choosing a new tablet.  I'm so glad I made that decision!The thing I love most about this tablet is its size!  It's about the same size as a small laptop, but with all the advantages of the Android platform.  I love Android!This tablet is fast, and there is a ton of storage space.  The only negative I have found is the same as on my previous Samsung tablet:  Some keys on the keyboard are ""wonky"" (for lack of a better word).  By this I mean, that when typing on the touchscreen, there are times when the key pressed results in a different letter, or even a number.  The ""T,"" for example, will often result in the number ""5,"" right above it.  I'm sure this is my fault somehow,  but it's irritating, nonetheless.Other than that small, occasional issue, I find this tablet to be a cut above my previous Samsung tablet, which had served me well, also.  But, it was time for an upgrade!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
12/20/2024,The big screen make the wonderful view,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
10/30/2024,"I’m making this review on the S9 tablet even though it was returned.  The tablet works great, the visuals are nice. The reason for the return is that it was too large and cumbersome for the individual who was going to use it.  He needed a smaller tablet to use.  This definitely is a good tablet.  I gave it four stars only because it was too large.  Otherwise it is worth 5 stars.",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
10/2/2024,"When my previous Galaxy tablet with S Pen began failing, I found out they no longer made that size tablet, with the minimum now being 10.9"", and I wasn't sure I was going to like it.I don't.  I LOVE IT!  Crisp display, smarter ""Smart Switch"" and built-in technology to lead you through initial setup than I remember from previous upgrades, made the changeover completely painless. Took a 1 TB memory card without issue.  Sound is better than you'd expect from a tablet this size, certainly superior to my old model.  S Pen feels sturdier (especially the pen tip) than others I've had.All in all, a great addition to the Galaxy family of Tablets with S Pen.A few weeks later:Love my Tab more than ever, every day I use it. Someone asked a question (which I was unable to answer or find again) about OTG adapter use. I put in an adapter and added on a 2 TB external SSD with no issues, was able to effect file transfers, play music off the external drive, with no issues. If you need more than the 1 TB that you can add as internal storage, no worries, theres's always a way to access more storage.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+
11/16/2024,"I am so glad I went ahead and bought this tablet. My last tablet was a Samsung from Verizon. Unfortunately, it and its case have seen better days. I don't need the internal wifi anymore since I am now retired and have little use for it outside of the house. I am glad to have bought the larger screen.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+

12/3/2024,"Ordered this tablet for my son's homeschooling and wasn't disappointed.  I'm not exactly an apple enthusiast, but I can't deny how well they make tablets, and how well they hold up over time.  Like all apple devices, it's super easy to use and apple FINALLY uses USB for charging which is convenient.  Apple products are always more expensive, but the quality and value you get is really unmatched.  Not too heavy to carry around, even with keyboard attachment and has all the latest connection options for wifi or 5G.",5,iPad Air 13inch M2

It is more like browsing the web using my desktop screen, and movies are large enough that it is almost all I use anymore for TV.  It is also very nice to be able to have more apps open and not have them immediately be shifted to background not running (my old Air was always losing my place even to switch just between maybe 3 apps).",5,iPad Air 13inch M2

Greatly appreciated that you have to sign or provide a code when it is delivered to you; they are not going to just leave it at the door.  Deliver took longer than expected, several delays, but we purchased it during the holidays and delays are expected during that time. Wish we had purchased 2 at the time. Wonderfully designed, so many features, you can't go wrong with Apple products. If you purchase any Apple products, make sure you purchase the Apple+Care, it is the best insurance warranty you can purchase with Apple and worth it.",5,iPad Air 13inch M2

10/23/2024,"Overall, I love this tablet. I debated between the 13"" and the 11"" and went with the 13"" because I'm getting older and my eyesight is not as good as it once was (need cataract surgery soon). A bigger screen sounded good and I thought 11"" wasn't much of an upgrade from my old tablet, and the price wasn't that much more than the 11"" - enough to make me think twice, but I thought it would be worth it. I thought 11"" might be enough, but 13"" would be a sort of insurance for the future as my eyes get worse.  But ... 13"" is too bulky. I should have gone with 11"". It's uncomfortable to hold or situate on my lap. And somewhat awkward for travel (plane, car).",4,iPad Air 13inch M2

8/11/2024,This model boots up very quickly when I power it on. I appreciate that. The battery runs down faster than i expected but the included charger works fast. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the high price. I bought the 13 inch version to display music sheets and the control app for my digital mixer. I appreciate the split screen option that allows me to run two apps side by side.I bought a 3d party magnetic folio cover and a non-Apple stylus/pen. They work well and are much cheaper than the Apple versions. The default iOS apps are annoying and restrict my ability to fully use the tablet the way I want but the apps I downloaded from the App Store work pretty well.,4,iPad Air 13inch M2
7/10/2024,"This replaces a 2019 10.2” iPad basic model that has started lagging pretty bad with every new update that Apple releases. I probably should have stopped taking them before ver 17.This unit is blazing fast. It is everything in my tiny off grid cabin, tv, web browser, ssh terminal, and though none of these uses are very cpu intensive the difference between the old and new is stark. This thing blazes.I certainly would not have bought it if Apple hadn’t crippled my old one with the newer updates. This is a thing that cannot be avoided - the axiom is ‘nothing makes old computers go faster than old software’.I was disappointed that my lighting accessories for reading usb thumb drives do not work with this unit regardless of what adapter I tried, you have to buy new ones. The good news is the cheap one ($15) I bought works fine.For TV I use the hdhomerun app with their dvr, the bigger picture is welcome on this display and the contrast looks better but the image is no sharper. The makers of hdhomerun change the ui constantly but the underlying interface to the tuners and dvr seemingly hasn’t changed in years, considering the number of crashes and bugs that remain unresolved, so I didn’t expect much of an improvement.",5,iPad Air 13inch M2

7/13/2024,"I waited a while before I wrote a review on this because I wanted to test it out and I’d say it’s been a few months now and so far everything is great. I had the old iPad Air 11 inch model before the M1 chip and I could say the upgrade to the 13 inch M2 iPad Air is pretty good. It’s a lot faster, and I can play any of my games on a bigger screen and the battery life is amazing. I didn’t realize how much of an upgrade it was going to be until I started using it, but but it does run faster and it has great battery life a substantial amount more than the 11 inch that I use, definitely worth it. The screen is the same. The speakers are a lot better. It is USb c I got the 256 GB model and it’s more than enough space to play Clash of Clans ANOTHER EDEN AFK Arena Marvel heroes and many other games. It runs Genshin great I can play call of duty on it and it’s a real workhorse. I hope this helps anyone who wants to buy it but I love it.

6/6/2024,I crack the corner of the screen of my IPad Pro 12.9 inch 5th generation with 128 gig  and Apple quoted a price of $749.00 to replace the screen.  Amazon quoted a price of $764.00  for IPad Air 13 inch with 128 gig memory.  My Pro had the M1 chip and from what I can determine the new Air is a little faster.  My old IPad continue to work so for a very small cost I now have two IPAD.  I did have to give up face recognition on the air however the finger print option on the air work great.  Very easy to set up by putting my old IPad next to the new air and it did all the work by copying everything from my old to the air.

But I do like it. Keyboard is a bit different too.Quality, clarity, and appearance is great. It is a lot faster to get connected. I don’t seem to be charging it as often.I went all out and got the most storage, so no problem with that with this one.I would buy it again or recommend it.

10/31/2024,"While the device itself may be OK, the process of setup and transferring data from another device is an exercise in hair-pulling rage-inducing frustration.  Apple seems to delight in writing software that goes into funky states that can take hours to return, without any user feedback or ability to interrupt.During the setup process it forces an OS update (18 to 18.1) which: (a) spends 20 minutes in ""Preparing Update"" with no feedback or estimated completion time; (b) If you aren't babysitting it, it then stops and does not install the update until you return and press the ""Update"" button, even though you already did that before; (c) The update itself seems to hang and never complete; I eventually gave up and rebooted the iPad, which did manage to bypass the update; (c) then it goes into data transfer mode, and never provides an estimate completion time, just sits forever on ""Estimating..."".As a career software developer I'm dismayed and appalled at Apple's software quality.Update: I found the only way to accomplish the transfer was to (1) do a full LOCAL (not iCloud) backup of my old iPad in iTunes on my PC; (2) Set up the new iPad as a new device; (3) Update the new iPad to the latest iOS (18.1); and (4) Restore from the backup using iTunes.  This worked flawlessly and quickly, with no hangs or extremely long pauses stuck on ""Updating..."" or ""Estimating..."".",2,iPad Air 13inch M2

I immediately put it in a custom leather case, got a new Pencil Pro, and put a Paperlike screen protector on it. It's my primary tool for work, and is great for travel. Are there lighter iPads? Sure, but not with this size screen and power. I'm happy to sacrifice a few ounces to have a device that will serve my needs for years to come.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

9/21/2024,"In contrast to my usual practice of upgrading my iPad Pro two years later, I made an exception due to a close friend borrowing my previous iPad Pro model from 2021. Unfortunately, he dropped or let it fall off the couch, resulting in a cracked screen.Since I was out of warranty, I quickly realized that replacing the screen would be quite costly. Consequently, I decided to gift the iPad to my friend and purchase a new one instead. Typically, I opt for the iPad Pro with the highest memory and cellular data options. However, my carrier, T-Mobile, was only offering a deal on an iPad at the time. They would have applied the credit to any iPad product in the past, but this time, they refused. Therefore, I saved a significant amount of money by purchasing the iPad from Amazon, which already takes a percentage off the top. This was the most favorable deal available for an Apple product.To further reduce expenses, I opted for an iPad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity. Given that I already subscribe to Premium iCloud services, it made no sense to pay for the highest level of memory.In summary, I made a wise decision by purchasing the iPad at a reasonable price. The iPad itself features several improvements, including the M4 processor, a thinner design, and upgraded cameras. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.While I typically purchase my iPad Pro through my carrier, which comes with a subsidy, I am retired now and occasionally consider commuting and traveling. However, my travel frequency is limited, and I can easily connect to Wi-Fi at home, restaurants, or other establishments.Logically, I was able to save a substantial amount of money by purchasing the Premium Apple product and opting for the iPad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity. I am very pleased with my decision.Although I could have potentially saved even more money by purchasing the subsidized iPad nine, I would have ended up paying more due to the monthly fee.In conclusion, if you decide to purchase an iPad, it is essential to get the Magic Keyboard case and the Apple Pencil Pro, as they complement the product and enhance its functionality.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

6/30/2024,"As a solutions architect who frequently works from home and on the go, having a reliable and high-performance device is crucial. The Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) has proven to be an outstanding choice, offering unparalleled power, versatility, and features that meet all my professional and personal needs.First and foremost, the Ultra Retina XDR display is nothing short of stunning. The 13-inch screen provides crystal-clear visuals with exceptional brightness, contrast, and color accuracy. Whether I am working on complex projects, watching videos, or browsing the web, the display delivers an immersive and vibrant experience.The iPad Pro's 512GB storage capacity is more than sufficient for all my apps, documents, and media files. While local storage is ample, most of my media files are stored in iCloud or OneDrive, so local storage wasn’t as important to me.The cameras on this iPad are top-notch. The 12MP front and back cameras produce high-quality images and videos, making it ideal for virtual meetings, document scanning, and capturing moments on the go. I use it all the time for online meetings, and nobody can tell the difference between this and a high-end camera in my home office setup. The addition of the LiDAR Scanner is a game-changer for augmented reality applications, providing precise depth-sensing capabilities that could potentially be useful for professional tasks, although I don't use it for creative tasks.Connectivity is seamless with Wi-Fi 6E, offering faster and more reliable internet speeds. This has significantly improved my productivity, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted online sessions, whether I am attending virtual meetings or collaborating on projects.Face ID is another excellent feature, providing quick and secure access to the device. It works flawlessly, adding a layer of convenience and security to my daily routine.The all-day battery life is impressive, allowing me to work, browse, and stream without constantly worrying about recharging. This feature is particularly beneficial for long workdays and travel.The iPad Pro's performance is unparalleled, thanks to the M4 chip. It handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking and running demanding applications to high-end gaming and content creation. The device is incredibly responsive and powerful, making it a true powerhouse in the tablet market. Despite packing such high performance, the iPad Pro is super thin compared to its predecessors and remarkably light, enhancing its portability without sacrificing power.To complement my iPad Pro, I also got the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro. The Magic Keyboard provides an exceptional typing experience and includes a built-in trackpad, enhancing the iPad's functionality and making it a versatile tool for work and play. The Apple Pencil Pro is perfect for taking notes, drawing, and navigating the iPad with precision.However, one minor drawback is the cost. While the iPad Pro offers exceptional features and performance, it comes at a premium price. Nonetheless, considering the quality and capabilities of the device, it is a worthwhile investment for professionals and power users.In summary, the Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) is an exceptional device that delivers top-tier performance, stunning visuals, and advanced features. With its Ultra Retina XDR display, 512GB storage, high-quality cameras, LiDAR Scanner, Wi-Fi 6E, Face ID, and all-day battery life, it is the ultimate powerhouse for anyone looking to maximize their productivity and creativity. Paired with the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro, it offers an unmatched user experience. Highly recommended for professionals and tech enthusiasts alike!",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

12/25/2024,"I have only had this iPad for almost a week and I paid a little bit under 1200 for this iPad and it was well worth the money for the 256 GB I still have an option to purchase AppleCare they give you 60 days which I am not going to be purchasing. The last iPad I had was the iPad Pro first generation 12.9 inch. which is still like brand new besides the battery which I had replaced for $100 and that was well worth the money, but it was time for me to upgrade and don’t get me wrong. I still use my first generation for certain things, but when it comes to speed performance, obviously this is by far superior. It’s not even close, but the iPad first generation only goes up to iOS 16, so it’s a matter of time before I’m not able to play certain games. I am very happy with this purchase.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
1/8/2025,I am an artist who has been tied to Apple for so long. I remember the iPad 1 and how it was not quite enough to fill the position it has now been able to with this new iPad Pro M4 and the Apple Pencil Pro. The price is higher and worth it for anyone who has digital art and design experience and needs. The coprocessor is just as powerful as the best iPhone and the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately) has a great capacity for drawing and sketching on the screen without some accessories that at best are not making use of screen illustrations. I am not sure why this pencil still doesn’t have the ability to swipe and maneuver within the iPad itself. But when you want to create and have a massive amount of real tools and a real brush feel: the pencil becomes a genius tool. So I still use a stylus and pencil for total control. But if you have wanted an iPad or have been uncertain about this new 2024 iPad Pro 13” amazing machine.. pay the extra and find peace,5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
12/23/2024,My current iPad is probably 10 years old and still working but I broke down and bought the Apple iPad Pro based on my daughter's recommendation. First thing that happened was the new one recognized my iPhone 13 that was nearby and automatically installed all the settings from my iPhone. So setup was a breeze! I did not buy the pencil or the keyboard but I probably will soon. The display on this iPad is noticeably better than my old iPad. The one problem I'm having is that the unit is so thin and light it is awkward to hold it steady and use it without it slipping out of my hands. I've ordered a case/stand to use with it which should help. Apple should probably include a case in the box. Otherwise I love this new model and hope it lasts 10 years like my old one.,4,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

8/21/2024,"Over all it works great.  Beautiful color..The cons I have are with Icloud.  I hate this future.  I just want to use the storage on my iPad but you can not.  The problem with this icloud is it is so difficult to delete stuff from it once it is there.  So if it gets full and your email won't work anymore because the cloud is full of pictures and stuff.  You end up buying more storage.  It is a scam.  But there is a place to stop storing pic at least.  Just know to turn it off right at the start.  You can not turn it off completely because some programs need it somehow to work.The other con is some of the programs that come with the iPad.  Are just not user-friendly.  You can not do tasks like rename or even name a file.  There are a few other small things that should be there.  It is like the developers never used there own product so they don't know what it is missing...Location is another problem.  You need it on for some things to work right.  Like London time.  But other places you do not want location on.  It is a game to find all the spots to turn things on and off.  And in the end, you are not sure you caught it all..The last con I have is you can not use your iPad to get any apps free or not.  Without giving them a visa # they store it for you.  I don't like to store visa cards online.  But they force you to.  I would prefer to just pay when I buy something.",4,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

8/7/2024,Best iPad ever! Uugh the iPad story! I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I promise you will either b laughing by the end or scratching ur head trying to figure out hw I did it! I drive to work and had a meeting and was looking for my iPad all day! Then drive all the way back home to look wasn’t there went back to work went to the class room I was teaching in and it wasn’t there but when I got back on the freeway with heavy disappointment and thought maybe someone had stolen it or would turn it in tomorrow it was like a 💡 went off in my head! I recalled leaving for work and thought I had hit the trunk button to open the trunk because I had started to drive and it sounded like I’d hit the button well it wasn’t the trunk button it was my iPad rolling off the top of my car! But my boyfriend says “ no way why wld u leave ur iPad on top of the car?” As we are coming down the Main Street I tell him ( I made him drive me after the 2nd drive back!🤭) “ thts where I thought I had popped the trunk open!” He sprints out the car runs across the busy street to see if it’s there! And oh boy was it there n a million pieces! As I see him running back I started to cry 🥹and he says “ babe keep driving I think it’s still missing a piece!” I couldn’t believe it! My 2 year old iPad was gone! So immediately I jumped on Amazon and bought this and I’m still getting use to it because it’s so thin but bigger than my old one but honestly this one feels and looks smaller than my other one idk why but it does but I still love it👌🏾,5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
11/16/2024,I saved up for two years then decided I really didn't need it since I already had an older version iPad.  I am so happy I purchased this iPad.  It works so much faster and the resolution for movies is beautiful.  This iPad is worth every penny.,5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

7/15/2024,"Go to one of the big tech review sites for the nitty-gritty details. I just want to add some personal / real user input.Just upgraded to the 13 inch M4 1Tb from a 1’st gen 11 inch Pro. GET THE 13 inch ‼️The extra screen size is amazing; it’s NOT too big. BRIGHT, yes ‼️ You can dial it up to “wow”. If you only use you iPad inside at night you will never need this level, BUT if you take it outside where the ambient light level is 30x brighter, you will still be able to use it. “Too much processing power” …. RIDICULOUS statement from short sighted critics. Next year or 2 years from now you will regret not getting the fastest processor available. I’m loving it NOW. I was slackjawed when I saw how fast it did video editing. You only buy old tech when you plan on living in the past.Battery life is excellent just like I expected. Fast response just like I expected. My photo library looks amazing ‼️It looked good before, and everything looks even better now; sharper, brighter, and more saturated. It’s like seeing all of these photos again but for the first time. Is it expensive; yes. It’s clearly a semi-luxury item but as an item that typically sees 2 - 4 hours of use per day for both personal and work purposes, it’s actually a bargain for the convenience.VERY SATISFIED",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

I was hesitant about buying the pro over the air given the size was identical and the screen didn’t look much different from each other. However, these two are miles apart if you’re trying to justify the price difference, I can help you out.The oled screen on the new iPad Pro M4 13 inch looks amazing, coupled with 120 Hz display makes it feel like 10 years in the future, I compared the sound quality of both the iPad Air and the iPad Pro 13 inch and again these are both miles apart. You can definitely tell although the iPad Air has good sound quality it’s only coming from two speakers the iPad Pro, M4 13 inch corporate four speakers the iPad Pro M4 also is thinner believe it or not over the iPad Air by no means do I think this is a dealbreaker, but it’s definitely worth mentioning. I didn’t notice the battery. Life does seem longer on the pro M4 13 inch as well and it does not seem to get as hot as the iPad Air through thermal imaging tests.iPad Pro M4 new improvementsOled display looks amazingSound quality seems better than everNewly placed Landscape camera makes it much easier for FaceTime and video calls as well as selfie videosBattery life seems better than everThunderbolt usb-c supports 40 gb per second transferApple now offers low monthly payments under $10 for AppleCare plusFuture proof with the M4 processorConsVery few to mention, however there are very limited cases out and available for at least the next month or so, but check out my review on the ESR case I found out a workaround that should fit most peoples needs without issue.Lidar camera has been removed, but should not affect most peopleThe 20 watt block included does a decent job charging, but there are much better options out there if you wanna buy an aftermarket block on Amazon",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

The issue is the old iPad is small and didn't have that great of picture, so it was past due time to upgrade.When i received the new iPad Pro 13"" it seemed massive in comparison but ultra thin. The first show I watched on it in bed was mind blowing how amazing it looked; the new OLED panel is hands down incredible. I have it attached to an arm that is mounted to my bed backboard. At the distance I have it from my face when laying down, it's like having a 75""+ screen in front of me with crystal clear clarity and vibrant colors.

It needs a big upgrade so you can justify paying that much money for it.  But of course, its performance is sublime in everything it does, the Pencil Pro works perfectly and I find it an essential accessory.

7/20/2024,"The new iPad Pro is an excellent device. The reduced thickness at first seems unnecessary but after holding it for a while this becomes a welcome enhancement. The device feels solid despite the thinner design. It works well as expected and battery life is at least as good as any prior version. The OLED display offer excellent image quality and a wide range of brightness levels. I appreciate having the toggle switch to limit charging to 80%. The space black finish matches my MacBook Pro exactly. The Apple Pencil Hover feature is a nice addition that allows you to see where you’re pointing before tapping (the mouse pointer follows the pencil tip in Sidecar mode, too).The center back of the device can get uncomfortably hot under some scenarios, such as working with layer masks in Adobe Fresco. I’m guessing this is an app bug as the iPad never gets hot, or even warm, at other times.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

9/30/2024,"I decided to upgrade my iPad after some time with my previous one and it was a good step up. I mainly use it to take pictures of my DJ gigs, work on invoices, and using the DJ app to tinker around and make new remixes. Pictures are crystal clear and would post on my websites/social media. Would highly recommend getting a case and screen protector for preventative purposes.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

7/13/2024,"My 2017 12.9” iPad Pro was amazing for its time and has served me well for the past seven years.. However, the Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) 256gb has proven to be an outstanding purchase and in every way - it’s a huge upgrade for me from the 2017 model. I tossed around the idea of downsizing to the 11” iPad Pro M4 - but the larger screen size of the 13” won me over.  The wight & size of the 13” M4 is considerably less than my old 2017 iPad Pro. So it’s feels much easier to handle than my old IPad and the screen size is easy on the eyes.  Very pleased with this purchase.",5,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
11/9/2024,"I have only had this iPad for 2 to 3 days and already I’m having graphic card issues. Although I do have the AppleCare insurance for the device, I feel that when you buy a product, it should last a good while before you begin having issues. This is the second iPad. I’ve purchased within a four year period. That has had issues. I thought that for the price I would be getting a solid product. I have tried to give Apple chances with its products, but I’m steadily seeing that the quality that Apple once had is now dissipating. I will not be purchasing another iPad.",3,iPad Pro 13Inch M4

I'm still glad I bought it though. The color is soooo much better here than on the iPad Pro 2017, which was my previous iPad. I have both and use both.

One which Apple advertised the efficacy and utility of the iPad and pencil.Months of calls to Apple support, multiple OS updates, and still no resolution for the issue.It’s an amazing machine, but it doesn’t do the thing at which it should uniquely excel and other computers do everything the iPad does better than the iPad.I can’t recommend spending your money on this iteration of the iPad if you intend to use it to take notes or do anything with the pencil pro.",2,iPad Pro 13Inch M4
1/19/2025,"I recently purchased the renewed Apple iPhone 12, 128GB, Black, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and performance of this device.  First off, the phone arrived in pristine condition with no visible scratches or marks—it truly looks and feels brand-new. The packaging was secure, and all accessories included were functional and clean. Setting up the phone was a breeze, and it worked perfectly with my carrier, thanks to it being fully unlocked.  Performance-wise, the iPhone 12 is as fast and reliable as expected. Apps run smoothly, the camera quality is stunning, and the battery life is impressive for a renewed device. The 128GB storage is more than enough for my apps, photos, and videos.  This purchase offers excellent value for anyone looking to upgrade without paying the full price for a new model. I highly recommend this renewed iPhone to anyone wanting quality, reliability, and savings in one package!",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
10/30/2024,"I recently purchased the Apple iPhone 12, 128GB, in Blue, fully unlocked and renewed, from a seller on Amazon. The phone arrived in Las Vegas via FedEx from New York in just four days, and the condition was generally good. It had minor scratches along the sides and a few on the screen, which was expected with a renewed product. However, the battery was only at 74% health, which was disappointing since it caused the screen to turn off occasionally and the battery to overheat.I contacted the seller through Amazon, and they offered three options: a full replacement of the phone, a refund, or covering the cost of a battery replacement at an official Apple store. I chose the battery replacement and went to an Apple store, where the replacement cost $89 plus tax. The seller promptly reimbursed me after I provided them with the receipt.A bonus surprise: while replacing the battery, the Apple technician accidentally damaged the screen and replaced it with a brand-new one at no additional cost. So, here’s a helpful tip—screens are glued in with waterproof adhesive due to water resistance, which makes them tough to remove without heating. This makes battery replacements essential on any phone that’s 4+ years old, and you might save around $300 on a new screen if you go through Apple for repairs. Only Apple has the equipment to program replacement parts into the system, ensuring everything works seamlessly, as good as new.Thanks to the seller for their prompt support and covering the replacement costs, making this purchase a worthwhile experience. Highly recommend!",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

1/11/2025,"I was nervous spending a couple hundred dollars on a used phone. I did a lot of research, read tons of reviews and was nervous about the refurbished phone mixed reviews where some people reported scratches, battery issues and receiving phones still locked to certain carriers. I don’t like cell phone contracts, and this phone was a fraction of the cost of a new model, with a nice return window, I decided I would give it a try. The phone came in like new condition, with a screen protector already installed. The phone had ZERO scratches and no indication of prior use, other than it arriving in a generic box. The setup process was seamless and with the phone completely unlocked, activating service with my cell phone carrier was a cinch. I have been using the phone for 3 weeks with no battery issues. When I’m in the market for a new cell phone, I’m definitely looking at Amazon refurbished phones first!",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
2/10/2024,"For starters; the price on these phones is great. Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
11/29/2024,"I purchased an iPhone 12 and spent over $100 for the Amazon Renewed Premium grade over basic Renewed, and overall I'm pleased with the phone itself, with a couple exceptions.The mute switch was filled with what I'm assuming was dead skin, enough to obscure the red marking. It should have been cleaned before being sold at this grade.The battery capacity should exceed 90% and this phone just clocks in at 90%. Not a big deal at 1% difference, but not what's listed for the renewed premium grade.The screen and body were overall blemish and scratch free although there was a residue around the camera lenses that should have been cleaned.I considered returning the phone, but I don't have time to go without one and the hassle of swapping data from my old phone.

I’m glad I chose this model—I can easily multitask without any noticeable lag.Condition: The phone arrived in good condition overall, with minimal signs of wear. However, I did notice a few light scratches on the screen that weren’t mentioned in the description. While they don’t impact functionality, it was a bit disappointing.Camera Quality: The camera takes fantastic photos, and the Night Mode feature is a game-changer. I love capturing memories, and this phone does an excellent job, even in tricky lighting situations.Battery Life: The battery life is decent but could be better. I find myself needing to charge it by the end of the day, especially with heavy usage. It’s not a dealbreaker, but I was expecting a bit more endurance.Value for Money: Considering the savings compared to a brand-new device, this refurbished iPhone 12 offers great value. For anyone on a budget, it’s a solid option.In summary, I highly recommend the refurbished iPhone 12 for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone. Just be sure to check the condition carefully beforehand. Happy with my purchase overall!",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
12/27/2024,"The phone is working well, the only thing is the battery dies pretty quickly. I got this to replace an iPhone 11 because it was only 64gb of storage so that was full so I couldn’t use the phone anymore. My iPhone 11 had way better battery life than the iPhone 12 that I just bought. And I had the iPhone 11 for more than two years. But this was a good deal for the 128gb so I might just need to get a portable charger",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/10/2025,"my first time buying a phone off of amazon, I was nervous at first as to the quality of the phone or how long it would last me. I've had it for about half a year now and I haven't had any issues with it! came as described, looked as good as new. I will say I expected the color to be more vibrant, photo didn't even really capture the slight color of the phone, that's how lightly colored it is. but it does have a slight green hue. I put a case over it anyway so it doesn't bother me too much. overall pretty pleased 5/5!",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/7/2025,This is a great purchase honestly the screen has minor scratches only visible if you shine a light on it i wouldve given it 5 stars but to my dismay the bottom right speaker didnt work. I was hoping for 100% batter life but i got 90% which is great in itself.,4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/23/2025,"I ordered (2) of them.  Both are in great shape.  One has battery life around 90%, not sure of other yet.  Only bad is the signature on delivery with Fedex.  Note to seller:  please have option to not require signatures.  Some of us have to take days off from work to sit in the cold to wait for Fedex.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/13/2025,"I received my phone right on time . I open the box and inspected the phone . The phone looks like i just received a brand new phone from Apple. The phone looks like it has never been used, I charged the battery and it shows 100% charged . The screen and brightness , speaker function absolutely flawless . I have not been to my phone provider to activate my phone yet, but if there is a problem I will let you know .",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

12/17/2024,"I bought my iPhone 12 here in about Oct 15 2024. Then on December 14, almost exactly 2 months later, the audio on the phone app stopped working.  Suddenly I was like a mime with a phone.  If I did a video call, I'd have to perform interpretive dance.I'm a pretty fair tech geek.  After running complete diagnostics at home and at the Apple store, both on the software and hardware, it turned out to be a $250 hardware problem. This was most likely because when the the vendor swapped in a new (non-Apple) battery, they did not seat it correctly.To be fair, iPhone 12's are also known for having phone audio problems (muting audio weirdly.)  But after extensive diagnostics, as I said, it did turn out to be a hardware problem.  It seems to me that a refurbished phone should work longer than 2 months.  And usually, they do. Just not this one.Now, maybe I could have gone to the trouble of returning and replacing this phone, But even if they let me do that, who among us can be phone-less for a week?  Even if you bought the insurance coverage, you'd still be out the phone for that long.  Normally, I don't mind unplugging on nights or weekends, but I need my phone for work.  So, I paid the $250 to Apple to fix it in a couple of hours.You do you, but honestly, until the vendor addresses that problem, I would steer clear, especially if it's an iPhone 12. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.",3,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

1/16/2025,"I was a bit hesitant about going for a renewed device, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised after receiving it. Thanks to Amazon’s super-fast delivery, the phone arrived in no time!The phone is in fantastic condition—absolutely no scratches, and the battery life is at an impressive 90%.

1/5/2025,I got this for my daughter who is 12 and I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a new phone. I was skeptical to buy it because it was refurbished and I wasn’t sure on the return policy and the reviews were mixed. Very happy with my purchase the phone looks brand new. It works great and the battery life Stays powered for longer than I expected. Can’t beat the price.,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
12/10/2024,"This was a replacement of my mom’s iPhone 7 Plus, so it was truly an upgrade. Set up was suoer easy and surprisingly, the battery health was at 100%. I expected it to be 80%. The only downside was a small crack that she found in the screen, so I have deducted one star for that.",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
12/29/2024,"I was worried about buying a refurbished phone, but with the phone prices, this was a great option for me. My phone arrived in like new condition, with only a few scratches near the camera (none on the actual camera lens). I was also worried about what the battery life would be like but it was basically like new! I have had this phone for going on 2 years now and have had no issues with it. I will definitely be buying another refurbished phone in the future.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

10/26/2024,"When I received it -- straight from the package -- the volume down button was kinda janky. It works, but kind of sticks a little, and it doesn't *feel* like it works. It makes zero audible clicking noise - which I, personally, think the clicking noise is helpful because I can tell I've pressed the button - and I don't feel it click either. However everything else has been just fine. (It also would have been helpful if the box it shipped in was labelled ""Unlocked"", which was how I ordered it, and not ""AT&T"", which was how it was *actually* labelled. However I was able to figure that out.)If thr volume key didn't have issues, I would give this product 5 out of 5.",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
2/27/2024,"I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years,  she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple.Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without  my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet!Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/6/2025,My first purchase of a renewed premium iPhone from Amazon!  It looked like a brand new iPhone.  All functions worked perfectly.  Very glad that I bought the premium renewed for my wife who so far loves the phone which was an upgrade from an iPhone 8.  Kanga was the supplier to Amazon and at least on this iPhone did a great job!,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

12/24/2024,"Got the premium renewed offering (Green Iphone 12). Just like new with 96% battery health after initial charge (has dropped off a couple of points after a few weeks, but no crater). A couple of small nicks in one corner,  very minor. Obviously never abused. I looked at a bunch of different 12's on a well known auction site.... I was very surprised how much similar beaters were going for. This one was a no brainer! I plan to use this for a while, so I paid up for premium! Thanks!",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
9/9/2024,I took very seriously my approach to buying an iPhone i researched all the different refurbished models on Amazon and I went online to various search engines looking for other reviews on potential iPhones.I even weighed the benefits of buying used versus new. I made my choice with this iPhone 12 and even paid an extra $10 to have it delivered sooner. When it got here I was very impressed as it had 100% battery life left. The transfer from my old iPhone took a while due to the fact it first had to be updated to the latest iOS version. After the update everything else was simple.But here's the problem. The Wi-Fi icon grayed out after 2 days leaving the phone unable to connect to the internet. I did hours of research looking at 10 different fixes and tried them all three or four different times. None of them worked and most reviewers who addressed this problem said if the fixes don't work it is probably a hardware problem with probably the internal antenna and that needed to be fixed by an authorized iPhone repair shop or someone else who knows what they're doing.That wasn't going to happen so I unfortunately had to send the phone back.,4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/10/2025,"I like the iPhone 12. There was a little problem from my side. They solved and told me the right answers. The phone works wonders compared to iPhone 7. If you have a chance get it. Feels great weight is just right, value is right on. Durability seems great saying that I just got.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
12/26/2024,"I bought this phone for a friend who is in hospice. The sound on her (very) old iPhone quit working.  It looks brand new even if it is refurbished.  I don’t know how long she’ll have the phone, but now I can talk to her.  It’s an iPhone…it will work perfectly for her.  She basically just uses text and looks things up.  Oh and the refurbished costs half as much as new.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

12/31/2024,"I was originally worried since it is a refurbished phone but its pretty nice so far. No scratches like other customers have said it had and good sound quality, id suggest them, though, I have seen some reviews that seem honest, and I can say there are probably bad batches but I'm happy I didn't get that! Wouldn't highly suggest, but its a good option for a relatively cheap phone.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/19/2025,The phone arrived quickly.  Outside of the phone is in pristine condition.  Battery health 87%.  Had no problems transferring my SIM to this unlocked phone.  I would use this seller again.,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/17/2025,I was impressed using it now was absolutely flawless definitely a great buy had the phone for about 3 months and no issues as I’m using it now and I’m a heavy talker texting etc,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
12/29/2024,"UPDATE: I researched and this charging issue is weirdly not uncommon with iPhone 12s. I did a hard shutdown for 10 minutes twice while the phone was plugged into the charger and it went up to 100%. I still think battery life is way too short, but it is now charging all the way up.I’ve already been through the massive headache of setting up this phone and logging into everything. I charged it first and I waited until I knew the phone would power on. I thought the battery went down quickly for a newly refurbished phone. This morning, I plugged it in to charge back-up from 20% and it tops out at 96% and will go no higher.I’m also not thrilled about chipping on the metal around the camera lenses of this phone.I picked a refurbished phone in the highest quality condition available (excellent) and from a seller with good reviews.If I return it, I have to go through all of the setup again. Plus go without a phone.",3,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/10/2025,"Phone looks brand new and it’s now set up with our US phone carrier. It was a great buy and made an excellent impression!  Perfect gift , the order also came ahead of time and quickly! Thank you",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/9/2025,"I needed to upgrade but didn’t want to spend a ton. This was a great alternative. The phone was in near perfect condition, you would have never known it was used. Better life was 85% which was fine with me. I would absolutely purchase another phone from them.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
12/19/2024,I ordered this phone because I’ve been needing an update but didn’t want to spend much on a new one. I was scared I was going to get 80% battery capacity but it can with 100% I’m so happy it did. It had some scuffs on the screen but that’s ok barely noticeable. But I thought the phone would’ve can with a usb-c charger but it just came with a regular usb charger. But that fine. I love this phone 100% would recommend to someone looking for a new phone.,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

9/12/2024,"I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by purchasing a refurbished phone that I wouldn’t be 100% satisfied. This is the second refurbished phone. I purchased through Amazon. My last one I purchased was a pixel and I missed having an iPhone so I gifted that to my daughter to purchase another iPhone. Unfortunately the battery life is not the greatest. The pixel I could use for two days without charging. This iPhone, I end up having to charge after dinner time. And I don’t use it that much. Like I said you take your chances when getting a refurbished item. So I will be taking a rechargeable device with me when going on longer trips..Otherwise it’s bigger then my SE I had before, which is nice but don’t like I have to OPEN my eyes to turn off my alarm, as every External button only puts your alarm on snooze",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/12/2025,The phone came great like practically new. The only thing that pissed me off is when the delivery guy threw my package at my door in front of my porch. Other than that the product is very functional,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

10/13/2024,"I’ve had this phone for almost 3 months now and the day that I got it the speakers were acting so weird. When the battery gets low, the phone is almost whispering. But now I’m starting to have issues with the screen.The screen flashes, the LED screen (green blue stripes) , I have to click the power button and restart it for that to stop. Apple won’t fix it because they said it’s an aftermarket screen they put on. Contacted the seller about the speaker and they told me to send it back, but then I would be out of a phone for a while having to ship it through the mail(as a mother, I need to have a phone on me at all times)…. I paid the extra money to get the highest quality of refurbishment…. Also When I received the phone, I had noticed a couple of dents around the back, but I didn’t mind since I put OtterBox on it. But on the back, you can see the back screen  was replaced before because it’s not closed all the way…. I’m assuming that means my phones not water resistant , But like I said, I just keep it heavy duty case on it… I had to save up for a while to get this phone, so I was kind of disappointing that it has a couple of issues. But unfortunately, with my situation, I just have to deal with it. I’m grateful that the phone can work When I need it, But I should’ve just got the basic refurbishment and not the excellent one…",3,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

1/20/2025,When I first got this phone I LOVED it but since then I’ve had problems left and right with it. I would return it but unfortunately the serious problems didn’t start until after the return/refund date passed. The screen glitches so bad and sometimes the screen doesn’t work at all. Overall I guess you get what you pay for even though I did pay over $300 for this phone when I could’ve just got one brand new (I didn’t buy a new one because I couldn’t find the purple one so I bought it from here extremely overpriced),3,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

Everything works perfectly, EXCEPT - the battery.  According to the settings it still has 81% of it's original charge available, but it honestly seems less than that.  Still, it stays charged a lot longer than the iPhone 11 and iPhone XS I was trading up from.  End of the day, I'm happy.",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

7/23/2024,"My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people.  I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it.  It is on a carrier that is not one of the ""big names"".  It suits my purposes fine.My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe.  This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there.  Believe me, I tried.  The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone.  I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering.  I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating.  They did not disappoint!The first phone I purchased was purple.  It arrived in excellent condition visually.  No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone.  It charged up to 82% which was great.  Everything was wonderful.  Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user).  I couldn't hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion.  Nope, wasn't me.MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone.  They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me.  The replacement phone was blue, but that isn't an issue.  It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new.  It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a ""new"" phone and to do your research on sellers.  Amazon offers an amazing choice to pick from.Hope that helps.",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/20/2025,Phone is just as described. No issues,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
10/17/2024,"Came in a box that said “SmartDevice” so you can imagine the drop in my heart when I opened the box—luckily there was an actual iPhone, cord, block, and sim card tool in there. I’m currently setting it up now and everything seems to be going as expected for now. Phone came perfect other than small chip in the paint on one corner. Otherwise, perfect condition and if it lasts longer than a year I’ll consider it to be a good purchase",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/13/2025,The iPhone was easy to switch over from the old one to the new one.,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

12/25/2024,The only issue was updating the software took a long time. We had to plug it into iTunes to move it along but once it finished it setup perfectly and is still working fine. Will buy phones refurbished from Amazon from now on.,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

1/11/2025,"Not advertised in the listing , phone charges extremely slow.  This phone doesn’t appear to have a genuine Apple battery. This is an issue because iPhones start to stop working correctly after a certain level of battery loss. Without being able to check the battery health , you have no idea how long his phone will last. Could be days weeks months who knows. For spending over 200 dollars on a 4 year old phone. not worth it at all. Due to poor battery health. Phone also came pretty banged up but I wasn’t concerned cosmetically.",3,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

1/17/2025,Its in almost perfect condition besides for a scrape on the bottom left corner,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
9/11/2024,It’s a pretty good phone. Works great my only issue is the top left corner of my screen is not secured into the phones housing and I did not receive a sim removal tool like stated in the description. I have not got ahold of the seller to have them replace the phone for the screen being messed up bc I am in need of a phone and just don’t have the ability to go without one for the time it would take to receive the replacement,4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
7/19/2024,"I purchased the (Product)Red 64GB version Refurbished - Excellent iPhone 12. When I received and unboxed the phone, I realized it looked brand new except what appears to be a small scratch at the bottom of the screen. Do I wish the scratch was on the back or anywhere else other than the screen? Sure but if that's the only blemish, I'm happy with it.Not sure if this is standard but mine came with a screen protector installed which happens to hide the scratch pretty well making it difficult to notice unless you're looking right at it.After I finished setting up and configuring the phone with T-Mobile, I checked the battery health. I would have been perfectly happy with a max capacity around 90% but to my surprise, it's 100%!!I purchased a red set of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live that are refurbished but happen to look new as well to pair with the phone. They work perfectly together and the red color of both the phone and ear buds are a great match.Overall, I really like this phone!! Maybe I got lucky with the condition but this is one of the better purchases I've made recently. I recommend this phone to anyone looking for a decent iPhone that can't afford a current model. I upgraded from an iPhone 8 so this a big leap from that. The differences between the newer models gets  less and less as you move up to the 15 so getting the 12 is a really good option. The 12 even has the same shape and size as an iPhone 15.Hope everyone who buys one gets a phone in like new condition like I did :)",5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/13/2025,Muy buena relación precio calidad,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
8/4/2024,My old iPhone “died” on me and it would have cost me almost as much to repair it as to replace it. This phone works very well. I was able to get most of my stuff back from my iPhone backups. There wasn’t much in the way of instructions and I had a bit of a challenge because my old iPhone had a button at the bottom to select and turn off apps and turning on and off the new iPhone was a bit challenging to figure out but once I got that “swiping “ the screen stopped apps and holding the power button with the volume button brought up the turn off option I was fine. I think the screen is better than my old one and now I’m accustomed to it I like the new iPhone better.,4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
1/2/2025,The phone arrived earlier than what the shipping said at Christmas so super fast shipping an thankful for the experiency!  The phone looks brand new and works like it's brand new.,5,"iPhone 12, 64GB"
11/9/2024,"the overall battery life is decreased slightly, however my phone does run great. was slight weary damage near the camera but other than that it looks great and clean. i highly recommend this if you dont wanna spend hundreds more dollars on a phone.",4,"iPhone 12, 64GB"

I went from a note 10 plus to two 2 S22 Ultras which were sold as excellent condition which were not and tried twice 2 phones on here and they came In terrible condition so I shipped them back and decided to buy a new S 24 Ultra . I love this phone. It came packaged well. It came with a charger but not a wall port.  That's fine with me. I'm still learning the new features on this phone being that it has so many awesome features and also I read that this phone is rated better than the I phone 15 pro max . Sound quality is great. The battery last a very long time. I took this off of the charger at 8am. I had a movie playing . I took phone calls and texts and it's now 11.5 hours later and it's at 50% . 10 stars just for that !! Also I placed a glass cover over the screen and lens and redid my finger print and you'd never know that I had something that thick on my screen. It reads my print quickly.This phone also takes wonderful pictures.  You can also remove shadows or add object or people from pics from previous phones or the one that was taken from this phone . Pretty cool. Overall this has been thee best phone . I'm so glad that I didn't settle for the 22 ultra. Going to update soon with some pics",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
10/28/2024,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for about two months now, and it's been a fantastic experience so far. From the start, everything about this phone has impressed me. The display is sharp and vibrant, making streaming, browsing, and gaming a pleasure. The 200MP camera is remarkable, capturing details and colors even in low light, which is perfect for anyone who loves taking photos.Performance-wise, it’s incredibly smooth; apps open quickly, multitasking is seamless, and the battery life can easily last a full day, even with heavy usage. I also appreciate the S Pen, which adds extra functionality and makes note-taking super convenient.One thing to consider is that it’s a bit on the larger side, so if you’re used to smaller phones, it might take some getting used to. Overall, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a premium phone in every way, and I’d highly recommend it if you're looking for top-notch performance and a fantastic camera.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra

Believe me It's well worth the money to go ahead and give this one so much better,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
7/18/2024,"I have waited awhile before i reviewed this product it is great for day-to-day use. At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself ""would you do it for one person?"". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.",3,Galaxy S24 Ultra

1/13/2025,"I bought this phone to upgrade my S22+ so far everything is working no scratches it came inside a plastic bag in the original box.

I did a full visual inspection no dings or scratches on the phone itself. Did a minimum set up to run self diagnostic on the phone everything passed. Continued with full transfer to this phone. Everything went well and then the phone prompted me for software updates. I am using T-Mobile. It is a unlocked U1 phone I am  getting 5g service. Saved a few bucks upgrading to this powerhouse of a phone. AAA+",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
2/15/2024,"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
7/24/2024,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its impressive 512GB storage capacity, sets a high bar in the smartphone market, offering a blend of cutting-edge technology, sleek design, and robust performance. Here’s a detailed review of this flagship device:### Design and BuildThe Galaxy S24 Ultra features a premium design with a sleek glass front and back, complemented by a sturdy metal frame. Its large, edge-to-edge display is visually stunning, providing an immersive viewing experience. The phone feels solid and well-balanced in hand, though its size might be unwieldy for users with smaller hands.### DisplaySamsung has long been known for its exceptional displays, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is no exception. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, making it perfect for everything from streaming videos to gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and responsiveness, enhancing the overall user experience.### PerformanceUnder the hood, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor (or Exynos equivalent in some regions), coupled with a generous 12GB of RAM. This combination ensures that the phone can handle intensive tasks, multitasking, and high-end gaming with ease. The 512GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it ideal for power users.### CameraOne of the standout features of the S24 Ultra is its camera system. The quad-camera setup includes a 200MP main sensor, ultra-wide, telephoto, and periscope lenses. The camera delivers exceptional photo and video quality, with sharp details, accurate colors, and impressive low-light performance. The zoom capabilities, up to 100x, allow for capturing distant subjects with surprising clarity.### Battery LifeThe phone boasts a 5000mAh battery, which comfortably lasts a full day of heavy usage. The inclusion of fast charging, both wired and wireless, means you can quickly top up the battery when needed. Additionally, the S24 Ultra supports reverse wireless charging, allowing you to charge other devices on the go.### SoftwareRunning on Samsung’s One UI over Android 14, the Galaxy S24 Ultra provides a smooth and intuitive user interface. Samsung’s software suite offers plenty of customization options and useful features, although some users might find the pre-installed apps and bloatware unnecessary.### Connectivity and ExtrasThe S24 Ultra supports 5G connectivity, ensuring fast data speeds and future-proofing your device. It also includes other high-end features like an under-display fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, and IP68 water and dust resistance. The lack of a headphone jack might be a downside for some, but it’s a common trend in modern smartphones.### PriceAs a flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a premium price tag. The 512GB model, in particular, is an investment, but it justifies the cost with its high-end specifications and features. It’s an excellent choice for those who demand the best in performance, camera quality, and storage capacity.### ConclusionThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 512GB is a powerhouse smartphone that excels in nearly every aspect. From its stunning display and powerful performance to its versatile camera system and ample storage, it’s designed to meet the needs of demanding users. While the price is high and the size may not suit everyone, it stands out as one of the best smartphones available in 2024.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra

12/5/2024,"I was upgrading from s22 Ultra on Verizon.  The upgrade went well. The difficult part of the process was Samsung login, despite that I was able to complete changing to the s24 Ultra.  The easiest process from my old phone to the new phone was by cable.  I did not like the color tones on the new phone.  It is apparently more accurate but not as pleasing as previous models.  With display adjustments it can be improved.I was interested in some of the AI enhancements as one of the reasons I updated.I did not find the performance notably different from my s22 Ultra.  The performance is good.I am satisfied with my purchase.  The s25 Ultra will likely be released early in 2025.  You might want to review the new features and decide if the s25 Ultra is more to your needs.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
1/4/2025,"Have had this phone for about a month, after upgrading from my Note10+ love it, and haven't had any issue with it. Although I will warn, that this phone does not come with those temporary clear screen protectors, it's black and needs to be peeled off to see the screen, so if you are the type of person to be OCD with avoiding you screen from getting scratched, definitley try to have a screen protector ready for when this comes in.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
1/24/2025,"This is my main driver device. The hot feature of this device is the introduction of Samsung AI. Helps with basically EVERY option of the phone. Pretty awesome device. Blazing fast. Beautiful display. Pretty good sound, and of course, S PEN",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/31/2024,"Love the phone in every other sense, but not having an earbud port is a major problem. Got a double to charge and listen to wired earbuds at the same time. That doesn't work out. Doing both at once has caused major interference on the buds the first time, and caused the screen to lock up the second time. Wireless headphones don't work for me because the latency is unacceptable. Don't know why all the manufacturers haven't recognized this issue and addressed it.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/25/2024,"I generally don't upgrade my phone on a very frequent basis. I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S9 plus, for a very long time. I finally decided it was time to bite the bullet and I made this purchase. I could not be more pleased. The S-Pen is great, the phone is lightning fast, the screen size is huge, the camera quality is great, and the built-in artificial intelligence features are really cool as well. Overall, I could not be happier with my purchase. The operating system and user interface is so much more user friendly than an iPhone.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/18/2024,"Speed and storage is impressive, as well as the quality of the camera and extensive battery life which seems to last all day.Unfortunately, unlike my old S21, the non-reflective coating used for the screen on my S24 Ultra is already in the process of wearing off, leaving streaks on the screen, no matter how much you wipe it or wash your own hands prior to use. This is a recent development with many other people reporting this issue and I don't know what to do about it, but only hope the screen will stay readable.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/7/2024,"This item was very easy transfer all my information from my old Samsung S8 using Samsung Smart Switch app.  The camera picture quality is great, has alot of different editing tools included and so far the battery has a long life span (2 - 3 days) .The phone DID NOT come with a sim card (first Samsung phone that did not).  Never thought about checking the size when purchasing a phone so I did not realize how big this phone was (more like a Phablet than cell phone).  The other issue I have is it is VERY cumbersome to change out the ring/notification tones.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/20/2024,"Cell phones come and go.  Have always loved this brand.  The last 2, however, have not lived up to the hype.  I feel this is intentional to get people to continually buy.  That is going to backfire, because they have lost my trust!  I don't know about anyone else, but tired of spending close to 2k for a phone that lasts maybe a year.  I'll go back to landline.  Especially when it seems it is useful more for them then us",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
1/16/2025,"Definitely enjoy this phone! I love the color and overall feel of this phone, and I love the functionality. Not much more to say, except it's earned 5 stars in my eyes!",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra

1/4/2025,"Like most cell phones they seem to self-destruct once the warranty goes out so we will have to see, I am not a fan of Samsung but so far after a month of use this phone has held up well I will update my review if I have any troubles",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/5/2024,"Took a chance with the Galaxy ultra 24I was the iPhone user for many years, from the 13 pro. Plus and now I'm a Galaxy 24 user, and I got to say I am loving it. I transferred everything my contacts, my photos to the new phone and the apps.  one thing, make sure you know all your passwords, because You're gonna have to resend it to yourself and renew it. But other than that, the phone is great along of new functionsIf your switching from an iPhone to a Galaxy. Make sure you turn off your iPhone messaging. So you can text people with iphones, 'cause if not, you're not gonna get any messages from them.It will receive it on your iphone.Instead when you send it from your galaxy-",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra

1/24/2025,Best phone I had ever bought works great I still have the phone best choice ever,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/3/2024,"I dont think the phone is properly insulated for electricity. I've noticed during charging, if you graze it with bare skin on certain parts of the edge, you feel what is a faint electrical current stinging your skin. Also, for some reason I feel my hands tingling when close to the phone as well and it dissipates when I move away from the phone. Something is off with this phone in that regardBesides that it works like it should and I have no other complaints",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
1/24/2025,Usually get my phones with Amazon never had a problem with them,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
1/2/2025,Ive been waiting so long to buy this phone and it was definitely worth it cause it's amazing and I freaking love this phone and it's definitely a upgrade from my s21 I bought 5 years ago.,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
4/9/2024,"I've only owned every version of the Note series (now Ultra) since Note 4 (did not own the bendy screen one, just regular). So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, ""hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them"".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's ""USED"" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was ""USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box"". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra

8/26/2024,"I upgraded from my Note20.  I really like having the pen which is the main reason I got it.  It has  a cool feature that I use quite a bit where you can hold down the home button and it will analyze whatever is on the screen or whatever you are pointing your camera at and then show you web results.  Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.  Also the weight is only about 1/2 ounce more than my old phone but it is noticeable.  If those issues were fixed then it would be a five star phone.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
9/6/2024,"I had the S23 ultra but ran it over by accident. I don't see a huge difference with the S24 ultra. It has a good camera with a good zoom which is important to me. It's now a 5x analog zoom instead of a 10x like the S23 but I don't notice a huge difference when it comes to zooming probably because the CCD chip is better at 50 megapixels instead of 12. It also does more digital manipulation with the picture afterwards which sharpens and cleans things up when zooming way in. I don't remember the S23 doing as much after you take the shot. I also notice a little bit brighter image when less light but that's probably because the CCD chip is a little larger to capture more light than the S23 ultra when it uses the 5x zoom lens. The biggest difference I see is the titanium instead of aluminum shell and it's nicer, it feels classier in your hands. I know the big hoopla is AI at the moment and Samsung is marketing it front and center, but it doesn't really make a big difference in my mind because the S23 with a firmware update has most of those features anyway. It is a refined highly powerful piece of equipment and a small step up from the S23 ultra from my experience so far.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/4/2024,Is a large phone and when case added it can be too big. Has great features and is very easy to use like most android phones. Doesn't come with a wall charger but does come with a cable. I don't take a lot of pictures with it so I don't think the 5 cameras (6 counting front) is a little overkill. Battery life is great. I can watch/listen to youtube for around 9 hours on a charge.,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/11/2024,"This product is pricey, but well worth the money! It is made of great quality, durable, has tons of storage & the camera (plus the photo editor) is absolutely AMAZING!

2/3/2024,"The bad:Screen colors recently fixed so I upped the stars to 3Reception is middling (compared to my Note 20 Ultra it's a bit worse)Camera white balance is straight green/blue and images/video are just darkWide angle camera is not as wide as my Note 20 and no better qualityWhen on speakerphone, the top speaker cuts out if you get close to the top speaker.Generally jagged user experience due to a bunch of Samsung crap that cannot be removed.Bloody expensive for something that's delivered in this state.The meh:Batt life is good (not great, just good) only if run in 60hz and low power mode.In low power mode at 120hz the batt life is merely acceptable.All compared to my 3yr old note 20 in low power 60hz mode which is just below acceptable.The good:The antireflective coating on the screen is genuinely amazingThe 120hz on the screen is uber smooth but unfortunately hits the battThe rest is fine; not different from my Note 20 UltraThere's a thread on the Samsung forum that's thousands of posts long about these same issues I've brought up here. The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20.",3,Galaxy S24 Ultra

A few apps suddenly have additional functionality than they did with the A42, some without even updating the APP!And the camera!

7/25/2024,This phone is awesome it's lightning fast switching between apps and loading games. the camera features are awesome. It's big but not to big fits in your hands just fine it's almost like having a mini tablet. The battery came 50 percent charged and charges very quickly. Also I like the color it's almost like a smoky black. I would definately recomend to anyone wanting a new phone to try the new galaxy series and also get one through this seller they are honest so you get what you pay for. The Samsung switch app made porting all my apps and emails messages calls and everything else from my old phone to this one a breeze just downloaded the app on my old phone connected them both to the same wifi network and clicked begin and it did the rest. As far as connecting it to my carrier (metro by T-mobile) all I had to do was contact customer care and register this phones IMEI number with them and then I was able to remove my Sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and that was it now I have a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra on the metro network.,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
11/14/2024,I love this phone! No problems been using it the last year and expect it to last! Will say the finger print will not work with a screen protector! And I hate that so make sure you have a good case at least,5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
8/22/2024,"I heard all the hype, watched all the videos and decided to purchase the Samsung S24 Ultra from Amazon, (Shipped & Sold by Amazon) or rather my FB community purchased this for me through gift certificates. I'm blessed to have them. Regardless, the whole thing started when I decided to purchase something to advance the FB page through the use of video and such. I haven't been disappointed. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING about this phone is phenomenal. I also run a Radar Omega, a weather radar app on this puppy and it just hums along. I haven't been this happy with a smartphone in years, it's incredible. It's a beast though, know that. It's big and unless you fiddle with the settings, not a one handed phone for most. Teamed with an Otterbox Defender case it's well protected. There's no point in spending this kind of cash on a smartphone and cheaping out on the case. Don't hesitate purchasing this monster, well worth the ducats. Everything about it is screaming your name, treat yourself.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
10/12/2024,I love my phone. It came brand new! It's unlocked and works with my carrier (Visible & Verizon and probably many more). The only thing I wish it had is emergency satellite commection like the iphone. I live in FL with hurricanes so that's important. I absolutely love my camera capabilities. It blows away any other phones. Everyone is amazed by the way the photos look. Unfortunately now all my friends make me take pics when we are out together. The phone has a very big screen which is nice for watching videos and playing games. It charges fast wirelessly or usb c. I read it even can charge other people's phones!

2/26/2024,I am very happy with the battery life and the charge quickness. the screen is bright and vivid. phone works as it is supposed to. I still don't like the fact that you don't get a charge block. it used to be an experience to purchase a smartphone. unboxing was have of the purchase. now they might as well send it in a zip-lock bag because you only get the phone and a cable. $1400+ I feel like Samsung has just charged me more money for less product. If you are like me and use the S pen daily then this is the phone for you but if not get the s24+ or just the s24. I got the s24 for my employees and they all love them good phones at a much nicer price point around $700.The battery life on this phone is bar none! I went about 56hrs without charging the other day and I was using it most of the time. I was taking video watching and editing videos. surfing for vday presents on line and talked to about 30 customers on the phone once I realized that I hadnt charged in two days and i still had 16% left I was blown away. My s22 ultra wouldnt even last the day and it would never super fast charge. this phone always charges fast about 38 mins to full from 5%.,4,Galaxy S24 Ultra
7/4/2024,"The phone is for me at least the best in the market. The only problem i've found is a little discoloration around the phone ports with just normal usr. The discoloration is not permanent, if you wipe it with a cloth it goes away and ut becomes as new. It's just annoying to have some parts of the frame get discolored with just normal and light use.Battery life with light performance mode is more than 24h, face unlock is a little hit and miss but fingerprint is perfect and fast, i used it for a month without any kind of protection and it didn't scratch. Charging is fast ( about an hour and 10 min from 0 to 100), the phone is very good looking, but the price is a little bit steep.",4,Galaxy S24 Ultra

6/28/2024,"This is my first ever refurbished phone. I already had a working phone, so I figured if it was trash I would just exchange it. But most of the reviews on here are very good, so I went with it.Packaging was OK. Comes in the original box, with all the accessories (charging cord, SIM tray pick and paper manual), but was slightly sloppily taped together in place of the original tear-away seals. Phone was missing the plastic removeable screen protector, as expected, and was instead placed in a plastic bag (though, not an ESD bag).Physically the phone showed up in basically perfect condition. No blemishes on the screen, back or edges. The only thing I found was a slight scratch on the silver ring of the outside of the top rear camera. But you can no longer see it after I installed a camera bump protector. Camera lenses themselves were untouched, which is the important part.S-pen works as intended. Phone was properly factory reset and it fired up as intended. Phone has been working flawlessly since it was received. Speakers, cameras, bluetooth, wifi, sim/network, all good. This was a great deal and I'm happy I went with it. It was like getting a big discount for basically a brand new phone. Would recommend.",5,Galaxy S24 Ultra
12/21/2024,I always buy Samsung products.  I connected the tablet through smart switch with my note 10+ and the tablet copied my phone in no time.

10/17/2024,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10, released in October 2024, introduces several notable enhancements over its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9.Key differences between the S10 and S9 series include:- The S10 series offers only two screen sizes (14 and 12.4 inches), eliminating the smaller 11-inch tablet from the lineup.- The S10 utilizes a high-performance MediaTek chipset, replacing the Qualcomm Snapdragon used in previous Tabs.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 delivers exceptional performance and features, making it a high-end, high-performance tablet. While the removal of the smallest tablet size is unfortunate, the iPad Pro, which offers comparable features, comes with a higher price tag, especially when considering the cost of a stylus (which is included with the Samsung).Published benchmarks have demonstrated that the MediaTek chipset in the S10 outperforms the Snapdragon used in the S9 in both CPU and graphics performance. Therefore, concerns about the switch away from Snapdragon are minimal for average users. The display remains unchanged from the previous year, retaining its exceptional AMOLED quality. The S10 Plus features a 12.4-inch screen, positioning it between the iPad Pro models (11 and 13 inches). The latest Tabs have incorporated an anti-reflective coating on the screen, significantly reducing glare and reflection. However, this feature is compromised if a glass screen protector is applied.Despite its lightweight design, the S10 feels awkward to hold due to its size. The smaller 11-inch tablet may have been a more comfortable option. The Samsung rugged case with stand is recommended for optimal protection and functionality.This tablet is an ideal choice for individuals seeking the best display and performance for media consumption, drawing, note-taking, and gaming. Samsung offers more affordable options, such as the Tab A and FE lines, for those who do not require premium features like the CPU and display. Additionally, the previous S9 generation remains a viable alternative when available at a discounted price.Pros:* Expandable storage* High-quality camera, outperforming the iPad Pro* Included stylus* Long software update support* Competitive pricing compared to the iPad ProCons:- Size is large for every day carry.Details:I have owned every iteration of the iPad and the Tab S series since the S4 model. As an avid enthusiast, I can provide a comparative analysis of these devices. In the high-performance tablet market, either the iPad Pro or the Tab S series would be suitable choices.If you are an Apple user, the iPad is the preferred option due to its seamless integration with other Apple devices. Accessories such as AirPods can be synced across devices, and mail and messages are synchronized across your Apple devices.If you are a Samsung smartphone user, the Galaxy Tab series is the more suitable choice. Samsung has effectively replicated many of Apple’s “secret sauce” features, allowing devices like Buds to sync across Samsung devices and enabling seamless calls and texting across devices.When considering a high-performance tablet for creative tasks like drawing or note-taking, both the iPad and the Tab S series offer excellent capabilities. The iPad requires the purchase of an Apple Pencil for enhanced drawing and note-taking, while the Tab S10 includes an S-pen. While the iPad+Pencil combination provides superior precision and a more advanced implementation compared to the Tab+SPen, the majority of users will not notice a significant difference.",4,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/13/2024,"I’ll start this review by stating I’ve been an Apple user for a really long time. I use a PC for work so I feel immersed in both the Apple and PC world. I was excited to get this Galaxy Tab S10+ to review. Overall, I’m impressed with it and admit it will take me some time to get used to the operating system.The hardware on this tablet is impressive. It feels high quality in your hands. It’s think and light for how big the screen is. The screen itself is gorgeous and movies and photos look great on it. The S pen is impressive with how accurate and sensitive it is. It’s much smaller than my Apple Pencil and seems to hold a charge for a long while. I’m definitely not a fan of magnetically attaching it to the back of the tablet. I’m afraid I’ll lose it. I’ve seen an advertisement for a case that has a bump on the back to go around the pencil and hold it there until it’s needed and then the a portion of the case folds back as a flap to expose it for the user to grab. I’ll have to look into finding a case like that. Overall, the tablet does feel like it needs a case for protection, as all great electronic devices seem to nowadays.I admit I’m having a harder time with the software on the tablet. Setup was simple enough that I didn’t have any problems figuring it out. I need to dig more through the settings to see if it’s possible to tap the screen to wake instead of having to press the wake button on the side. The Home Screen is reserved for only the apps you specifically add as all new downloads go to a screen that requires you to flip up to get them to show. You can lump similar apps together into a folder and then long-press the folder (or individual apps) and say add to Home Screen. Then you can move it around the home screen wherever you’d like.For me, the biggest pain with every Android device I’ve tried is the double accounts. During the set up, I had to create a Samsung account and log in with my Google account. Then, you have two stores you have to juggle. I try to only use Google’s Play Store to find and download new apps. This fragmentation is annoying to me coming from the Apple environment where everything is in one place. I’m sure Android users would tell me this fragmentation is better for the user as it allows competition between companies. Well, I’m not sold. Also, I really hate giving all of my biometrics to Google or Samsung who will probably end up selling it. I feel like that kind of personal data is (hopefully) safer in Apple’s hands who is always touting privacy. Is any corporation really safe?Again, I’m impressed with the hardware and given time I’m sure I’ll adjust to the software. If you’re already an Android fan, this tablet should impress and delight you.",4,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/13/2024,"I have been an Apple person for years, but decided I wanted to move on and work with something a bit more flexible.  So ordered this Galaxy Tab S10+.  The first thing that struck me is how big it is.  With a 12+ inch screen it is definitely bigger than anything Apple offers in the iPad realm.  I definitely have some learning to do to understand and take advantage of everything the Tab S10+ has to offer, but I'm getting there.  The pencil / stylus is a new thing for me (I know they've been around for a long time, but I've never ventured down that path, even with the Apple version), but I find I'm using it all the time.  It comes with tons of included apps, a lot of which I'm still exploring.  The Samsung also will transfer over apps and data from my iPhone (or iPad).  Now, while it didn't transfer everything, it surely did a lot, saving me a ton of time downloading and installing various apps.I'm not a huge fan of -- and it's not Samsung's fault -- the fact that it can be difficult j(for me) to hold, because it's so big and at the same time thin.  Also, I've had issues getting the facial recognition part of the biometrics to unlock the tablet working properly; I've calibrated it twice, but it keeps telling me it doesn't recognize my face.  Possibly a user error, but I have to say I never ran into that problem with my Apple products.  And finally, getting apps to group into common folders has been a challenge -- one day I can get it to work, and the next no luck; this is an area Samsung could certainly improve on.Overall, this is a big, beautiful, powerful tablet, and I'm enjoying getting to know it better day by day.  Is it a bit pricey, perhaps.  But heck, they all are.  Bottom line, though, is I heartily recommend this S10+.",4,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/17/2024,"So far this has been a pleasure to use on a daily basis, anything from Youtube, Jellyfin, HA and the very welcomed Samsunt TV app shows in great detail and feels snappier than the already fast S22 Ultra which is my yard stick for Android flag ships.The last Android tablet I bought was a Galaxy Tab A back in 2016 so this is obviously a huge improvement in both performance and display quality. The anti reflective technology is noticeable when compared to my S22 but unfortunately that went away when I added a Tab S9+ compatible screen protector (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB1NVTQV).  Samsung hasn't officially released any S10+ screen protectors as of the writing of this review. I hope they eventually release one that will compliment the built in anti reflective feature, I really liked it as it makes media consumption more immersive in any sort of artificially or naturaly lit environment.One of the immediate upgrades on mine was the very versatile S9+ compatible, Mil-spec, Samsung made case with the adjustable stand (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C79JG8GG). It fits (barely) with the screen protector on and has been the best accessory I added to my S10+ so far. I was going to grab the official S10+ AI enabled cover+keyboard but I use my tab mostly for media consumption, smart home controls and gaming so there's no need for that yet. If you do a lot of office work then the cover+keyboard combo is a must but you will have to pay a pretty penny for it.I ran some benchmark tests and the results were very impressive. Not only is it faster than my S22 Ultra (which is to be expected) but it apparently beats the current S24 flagship as well. The new MediaTek chip seems to be holding its own so far. It also runs cold compared to my S22 but the tab has a lot more real estate for cooling.Another improvement over my S22 is the WiFi reception, having both of then together and running speedtest trials I get at least  200% better speeds on the Tab vs the S22 Ultra. Watching high quality videos is more enjoyable on the s10+, there is no stuttering or buffering on my regular Xfinity connection which is not something the S22 always gets right.I tried the AI functions and while they are impressive it's not something I found myself using as much as I thought I would. Setting up easily called up air pen functions with AI integrations can boost productivity in Office like apps and maybe in some creative apps but it won't replace a dedicated workstation anytime soon. If anything it can supplement a main workstation through Dex functionality which is a very cool feature Samsung has been offering for awhile and has been improving since inception. Technically you could use the Tab as a Wacom input for your main workstation or a mobile sketch book when away from the office. The pen is very sensitive and accurate and it should allow decent performance for sketching on the go, the sensitivity felt natural and the tip glides smoothly over the tab's screen. I noticed some ghosting and jitter after I installed the glass screen protector.Overall I really like the new S10+, for me it made sense to upgrade from the older Tab A. Battery life is great, I watched the new Beetlejuice in 4k and it only went down about 15%. I charge the tab every 3 to 4 days and it sees about 3 to 4 hours of use daily, mostly media viewing.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
11/11/2024,"When using a new tablet, or really any electronic, for a long period of time it's easy to forget that you are using the latest and greatest product. The new Tab S10+ is an exception of that. Samsung makes sure to remind you that you're using the best Android tablet in the market right now in terms of hardware and performance.Starting off with my favorite thing about it, the 12.4"" AMOLED screen. It's big and it took me a while to get used to it (coming from a Pixel Tablet) but it is STUNNING. It's an AMOLED display so the blacks are deep, colors are vibrant and the screen's brightness is unmatched.The performance on this thing is also remarkable - I mainly use it for media consumption, school, and some gaming (ZZZ, PUBG, and Brawlstars). Usually while playing ZZZ, I'll have a youtube video in the background and while this may not be the most demanding of tasks, the Tab S10+ does not lag one bit.While using it on campus, I've paired a Bluetooth keyboard to it and use the Samsung DEX feature which provides a laptop like experience that's as smooth and responsive as the tablet experience is.Another notable feature has to be the S Pen. It took me a few days to get used to writing on the screen with the S pen, but once I got the hang of it, it just feel natural. I'm mainly using it for hand written school notes but I've caught myself scrolling through videos and shopping on Amazon with it.The hardware overall is very impressive - from the battery life to the aluminum frame body the tablet feels very refined and premium. The software on it is also impressive and should feel familiar to Android users (and hopefully welcoming to iOS users). So it is no surprise the this the Samsung S10+ is EXPENSIVE! If your willing to shell out the current asking price then your high expectations are likely to be met here.There are something that Samsung can improve but these are probably things that the average user can get by with. My first example being the charging speed. While it's not slow AT ALL, the OnePlus Tab has 67w charging that can easily sway some potential buyers. My other example is the magnetic hold of the S Pen - the hold is sufficient and won't let the S Pen loose but it can be accidently pushed off.Overall, I think the Samsung Tab S10+ is the gold standard of Android tablets as of this review. It may be overkill for some users but if you need top of the line specs, performance and usability, this one is it. Would definitely recommend to people looking for a high end tablet!",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/26/2024,"Writing this review from the perspective of a first time Android user.SETUP pretty much consists of agreeing to a bunch of terms I never read, and attuning the device to both a Google and a Samsung account. For the former there are various privacy opt-outs such as non-personal ads and whatnot. For the latter you really kinda need to have that Google account do anything useful and the Samsung account is necessary for the AI stuff and various other features like device tracking. I could skip the creation of a Samsung account but eventually gave in in order to engage with the other features.SCREEN quality is amazing. I think it looks as good or perhaps slightly better with web browsing and text clarity than my IPad. Seems easy enough to wipe the smudges clean.PEN is quite precise but I still want to use my fingers. I've never used a pen before so I don't have a handle on all the gestures. But the tracking is spot on and I'll rarely have to re-do any motion. Writing with it is smooth, there's no friction and the handwriting detection is pretty great at getting the words right but the odd uppercase letter shows up where it shouldn't. Oh and the pen can magnetically anchor to both the top and the rear of the device. I have noticed repeated alerts about the pen not being synced but it never stops functioning so I don't know what that's all about.UI is where I could probably nit pick a bunch of stuff and I have a feeling that its mostly due to my familiarity with Apple's UI. But things like how whenever I go to enter a text field the on screen keyboard doesn't automatically appear. I can write into the field with the pen but the field is small. Now I don't know if this is something I can change in settings, it just stood out as something odd.AI hmmm, well everyone is all about AI these days but it seems to me the hype exceeds the reality. Sketch to image is highly amusing, and fast too. I must have spent almost an hour drawing cats and various other simple figures. The recognition is scary precise because I have absolutely zero illustration skills and yet the AI converted my scribbles into exactly what I had intended. Beyond that the circle to search is neat but its one of those tools I just remember is there to use. And then there are various other ways in which the AI is integrated but it seems to me certain things are going to be more for the power-user than the casual.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
1/4/2025,Man what can I say or start. I upgraded from a Samsung galaxy tab s5e and the difference is night and day. Love the bigger screen size over the 10 inch dex works a lot faster now able to draw and use s-pen if I want wow it is so much faster with the new cpu colors are so bright and lively brightness is great too. Love it that my tablet is just as fast as my phone now and can handle any and everything I want to do with it. Sound is great with lots of added adjustments and filters added watching movies with atmos on is so much more immersion and seems like it is coming from all around you. Gaming can handle any and all game with no problem on high settings and good or high frame rates. I have the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and it's going to take me some time to learn how to use all the good and fun apps. Trade ins for the s10 plus or ultra are good too as of now if you want to upgrade. If you have a tab s9+ or ultra you are good wait for the next tablets upgrade.,5,Galaxy Tab S10+
12/31/2024,"Here are the directions to formatting the S10+ and I am using mine that way so it does work. Yes, a Micro SD card on a Samsung S10+ can be formatted for internal use, meaning you can essentially treat it as an extension of your phone's internal storage to store apps, files, and media directly on the card; however, once formatted this way, you cannot easily remove the card and use it on another device without potential data loss.How to format a Micro SD card for internal storage on a Samsung S10+:Go to your phone's Settings, Select Storage, Choose the Micro SD card you want to format, and Tap on ""Format as internal storage"" option.Important points to remember:Data will be erased:Formatting your SD card as internal storage will erase all data currently on the card.Cannot be easily removed:Once formatted as internal storage, it's strongly recommended not to remove the SD card frequently, as it can cause data corruption.Might require a system update:Depending on your phone's software version, you may need to update to enable the",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
11/15/2024,"I'm not sure how I can sell anyone on this - by now most people know what they want from a tablet and know that Samsung almost always delivers. If you're an Apple user this isn't likely for you, not because of any missing or unusual features, but because it runs Android. There's a big adjustment if you switch from Apple's ecosystem to Android, so if you're thinking about doing so prepare yourself for quite the learning curve.Now, onto the tablet. The screen is brilliant, absolutely breathtaking quality. The touch sensitivity is perfect, with and without using the pen. The glossy finish makes everything look so crisp.In terms of speed, this is a lightning fast tablet. I've had zero issues with lag or performance. And, despite the performance being so good it still gets amazing battery life. What's most impressive about the battery life is the standby time. I went away and left my tablet home and unplugged. Over a week later it was still going, even keeping up with notifications. I find that to be very impressive.For connectivity I had no issues. Wi-Fi setup was a breeze and Bluetooth devices pair with no problems. A find a folding keyboard is very useful for tablets, as it greatly increases productivity when using the tablet for more office centric purposes.Storage capacity is plentiful, even overkill. 512 GB goes a long way with a tablet. I don't do much in the way of taking photos or videos with it, as I find tablets too bulky to enjoy photography with - so in that regard, the storage is substantial overkill when you don't plan to take photos or videos with it. But if you do, you'll still be fine for a good while.Overall, this is a top tier tablet. It's very pricey, but you get a lot for that price. One very annoying thing though is that, like Apple, Samsung has decided to take away the power charging brick from the box. At over a thousand bucks that's just super annoying. This should be provided, as charging over USB-C without it is much slower.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
12/6/2024,"This Samsung Galaxy Tab is nothing short of impressive. Its 12.4-inch OLED screen is a visual treat, delivering rich, vibrant colors, though they lean a little on the saturated side—a signature Samsung touch. The aspect ratio, slightly wider than an iPad Pro, feels perfect for media consumption and gaming, offering an immersive experience for streaming movies, YouTube, or remote gaming via GeForce Now or PlayStation Remote Play.One standout feature is the included pen—no need to buy an extra accessory! It’s precise, responsive, and excellent for drawing or note-taking. Samsung has also packed in some cool Galaxy AI features that add functionality, like solving math equations from handwritten notes or generating images from sketches. These smart additions elevate the experience, making the tablet feel like more than just a screen.The design is sleek and incredibly thin, making it a joy to use and carry around. With 512GB of storage, it has plenty of room for apps, games, and media. As a device for note-taking, gaming, and especially media consumption, this tablet shines. The OLED screen delivers breathtaking visuals that make movies and videos pop, making it an excellent companion for work and leisure alike.Summary:A stunning tablet with an impeccable OLED screen, included pen, and smart AI features. Perfect for gaming, note-taking, and media consumption, it’s a versatile device that delivers a premium experience.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/8/2024,"I've only had this tablet for a short while and being the first tablet I've ever had I can't compare it to much but so far I am really loving it. The AI features, which I think are new in this generation, are really cool. The way it helps you straighten out your your handwriting is really helpful and fascinating how it works. The AI can help you format your handwriting and create documents from information you write down. That being said, the AI is not perfect in understanding my handwriting but I should say that I have really terrible penmanship, so it's no surprise that it doesn't get it perfect. It's all quite mind boggling thinking about its potential uses and I know I've only scratched the surface when it comes to the productivity benefits that the AI features will assist me with.As for the size of this tablet, I like it. I think the larger size would have been too big, this one is just the right size for me. I can carry it around with me throughout the day without it feeling like I'm lugging a TV screen around with me. It's quite light without feeling too light, like it could break very easily. It feels durable in the hand and I feel comfortable taking it with me wherever I go.Multitasking with this tablet is super fast there's pretty much no lag time even when I have multiple applications open and I've even been able to do some light gaming emulation on it which I was surprised to be able to do. I didn't think a tablet could be used for gaming.This is just the 256 GB version but it has an expandable storage slot. If I remember correctly you can fit a 1.5 TB micro SD card in it to expand your storage which I intend to do.This certainly isn't a cheap product but you really get your money's worth from what I can tell. I look forward to discovering new and exciting features about this tablet and if you can afford it Id recommend anyone else to buy one when they can. This is a great product made by a mainstream and well-known company so potential buyers should not be concerned about the quality of the product they're getting. I would rate it 10 Stars if I could but since I can't, 5 stars all the way!",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/18/2024,"The new Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ is a large sized 12.4"" tablet. Screen is bright and vivid. With a narrow bezel edge the viewing area is large. The tablet has a very narrow profile but the power buttons and volume buttons are easy to feel and access. They have a nice responsive press and feel. Tablet comes designed with a business like aesthetic. Screen is bright and clear with no pixel issues. Most videos are nice and clear, though it does have some blurring with darker movies (Hulu, HBO/Max, Youtube etc) just due to the resolution. I compared with the iPad Air 4th gen and they both seem to have the same issue as both are the same resolution. The tablet is hefty at almost 2lbs and even more so when added to a protector with keyboard. It feels pretty much like a laptop and operates as such if you have a keyboard with a touch pad. Setup is easy with a google account, and you can transfer data/apps from another tablet or your phone. No issues using iPhone to transfer data from phone to tablet. Some apps have to be searched for the android version which wasn't that big of an issue.  The pen is a great feature, it charges while sitting on the back but can be attached to the side magnetically between uses. The pen AI drawing is amazing and probably what most people will enjoy right off the bat. The pen is comfortable lightweight and very responsive.Overall a powerful tablet with a huge screen size. I'd recommend getting a cover that has a keyboard and touch pad and it basically becomes a tablet/laptop.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
11/13/2024,"It's my first ever Andriod OS tablet and I'm thoroughly impressed. I have a M1 iPad Pro 12.9"" and used it for all these years. At first, the Andriod system was definitely a headache and I spent a handful of hours getting used to it. However, once I learned the basics, it was quite simple. The display was absolutely amazing and didn't fall short compared to my iPad Pro. The ability to insert a physical SIM card to add cellular service is also a huge plus compared to the iPad Pro which the WIFI-only model is not able to achieve. The biggest rip-off I always felt about Apple products was the non-upgradable storage size. This tablet, however, lets you upgrade your storage with a microSD card whenever you want. Plus, this tablet comes with a PEN! I hated Tim when I had to pay $80+ for an Apple Pencil for my iPad Pro.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/9/2024,"My first Android Tablet (after many iPads) - I finally ventured into an Android Tab, in part because I trust and am familiar with Samsung since all my “phones” are Android Samsung, and yes S series!Immediately felt at home and had a certain familiarity! - Setup was super super easy through their software (Quick Switch), which also supports iOS and other Android products. - Within 30min everything was copied (but you can manually filter ie not all pictures, or videos, or other settings), and the only thing left was to sign in for the first time into the various apps.  Syncing (Google Store) Apps is also great.There is nothing (so far) that disappoints, but many items extra you don’t necessarily get (yet) with Apple - their much advertised FREE AI integration being probably the biggest; but also their included matching S pen, that was new to me! - Still learning but liking it for sure - smooth and responsive. - Also included are a multitude of extra software, at least free for 6 months to try, geared towards AI integration and S-Pen support: ClipStudio, LumaFusion, GoodNotes to name a few. Overall just a great product, but possibly would opt for the S10 (not plus) - 11” version next time, just a tad too big to just grab for on the go - gaming included, don’t need that big of a screen for that.** Overall **Great technology, first to offer multitude of working AI integration; co,es with integrated S-Pen and software; and supports Google and Android freedom!All boils down to are you an Android or iOS fan - if the former this is definitely you go to powerhouse! - Can’t go wrong with 7 year support and separate removable storage expansion slot instead of paying for internal storage.🌟 5  STARS⭐️ -> (*My RATE SCALE*: 5=perfect; 4=minor imperfections; 3=on fence;  not sure if I’d buy again; 2= too many problems; 1= shouldn’t be sold or is dangerous).",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/10/2024,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ Plus 12.4” 256GB -  I'm definitely impressed by the obvious enhancements, but also by others I hadn't expected - for example the anti-reflective screen makes a huge difference and using it outdoors is much easier now. I'm talking no squinting, it's a huge improvement! It's also slightly lighter than my older GT S9 Plus. Performance-wise, it handles everything smoothly, from work tasks to gaming, everything I throw at it is absolutely perfect and the battery easily lasts a full day for me.The S Pen is very responsive, and Samsung's new AI features seem quite useful so far. I especially like the note-taking ability. Audio quality is good, but I miss the AKG branding. The optional keyboard case types well, but lacks backlighting. Camera quality is decent for a tablet, but let's be honest - who takes serious photos with these?If you've ever used a non-android high end tablet, you probably know how restrictive the UI feels, right? Samsung has improved this by leaps and bounds. The experience feels more like true multitasking environment and not some phone OS shoe-horned into expensive hardware. Watch some videos on Samsung DeX on the Galaxy Tab to see for yourself.Overall, if you want a powerful tablet that's not as massive as the Ultra, this hits the sweet spot. It's pricey, but the SD card slot and included S Pen add value.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/26/2024,"Since my very first smartphone, I have not tried any Android device but I didn't want to pass on this opportunity to get a Galaxy Tab S10+ Plus because of its big screen.So far, my experience has been positive, and I have found myself using the tablet more for personal items than my personal laptop. It's definitely great for consuming content and Samsung mastered the ease of use for multi-tasking (like chatting with friends on Messenger and watching a video at the same time).The battery lasts surprisingly long, and the pen is responsive and precise even though I don't use it much.Granted that the price point for this table is pretty much the same of a laptop but I still think it's a good idea and I recommend it.My favorite use of this tablet is to watch entertainment on long flights, the screen is amazingly sharp and big enough not to fatigue my eyes.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/13/2024,"If you're not a diehard Apple person, this is a perfect alternative. I already have an iPad 10th gen that I love, but wanted to review it's main competition, the Galaxy Tab. I was very impressed. As for the screen quality, speed and ease of use, this is a real competitor. If you're new to tablets, and you're still making a decision, and you don't want to be tied into the Apple universe, AND you want to save hundreds of dollars, get this tablet. I've had iPhones and iPads since they first hit the scene years ago. It's a well known fact that Apple tends to be VERY proprietary. That means they don't ""play"" well with others. If you're invested in the Apple universe, you're kind of tied to that. The Android world however, has always been known to be more ""friendly"" to other technologies, a more ""open"" universe. Years ago in the beginning of all this, that was often a liability. In the Android early years, you never really knew if an app would work as it was advertised, or if a rogue app would screw up your Android phone or tablet. Any app that was made for Apple had to be approved by Apple and certified to work and not harm your device. Apple tended to be a little safer to use. That era has pretty much passed. So do you get an iPad or a Galaxy? Unless you're an artist or an architect who uses serious microprocessor intensive dedicated software designed for the iPad, today there is little reasons to spend the extra money and invest into that Apple universe. Get a Galaxy s10, go through the Android learning curve, which in my opinion is a bit easier than the Apple learning curve, and never look back.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+

The performance and battery life is about the same, but I feel like you get more bang for your buck with the Galaxy Tab. For starters, they include the pen and it’s much more responsive and functional which is important to me, because the main reason I use my tablet is to write. I find myself reaching for this more and more to write in daily over my other tablet.I also love the built in AI capabilities and that the setup in general gives more of a laptop user experience. Overall, I think that this tablet is impressive and a great value for the money especially considering the functionality and what’s included.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+

10/7/2024,"You get what you pay for. I've had many different models of Samsung and other brands of tablets over the years. The S series has the highest performance, best display, and exceptional sensitivity. The enhancements of the included fine touch pen significantly improved over previous tablets. It is more responsive and has a better screen than my current S22 Ultra.The setup was surprisingly easy using the latest Samsung device transfer. It took about an hour to complete the entire transfer with very few prompts to action. Logging into all of your apps again is annoying and unavoidable.The tablet itself is thinner and lighter than my last 10-inch S series. I have a small series for casual use that now seems slow in comparison. Both have a purpose and use case.The only downside is that the pen attaches to a thin groove on the back to charge and sync. This is inconvenient and I am constantly knocking the pen off. It would be much better if the pen were on one of the sides, especially the top. Every time I set the tablet down, I risk knocking the pen free. It is not a deal breaker, just an unfortunate design gap from an otherwise amazing tablet.If you are looking for a workhorse tablet where you'll be using the pan a lot this is worth the investment. Say general use 10-inch tablet; get it if your budget allows. Browsing and videos the Samsung A series is a better value.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+

Did I want to connect with my Apple account?  Yes, yes I did.  Then I realized it was just being polite because nothing Apple account related move over or was downloaded.Set up-Not great.  Still struggling to set up an account.  Have gone through the ""validation code"" several times now.  Each time, I hit a circle of ""you have tried too many times"".  I seem to be stuck in this mode for the moment.  Might be why my apple stuff didn't come over?Exploring-Opted to see if I could explore past the set up, because it did at least allow me to do that.  Not a great journey.  I downloaded a few apps.  Where did they go?  I have to search for each app every time instead of just seeing them in a group or file that I can grab.  I find this awkward.Speed-It runs fast.  I like that.  Browser search and explore is great.I expect a lot from a tablet.  Like an extension of my laptop.  With the frustration of the set up, I suspect I am only getting about 10% of what this tablet can do.

10/5/2024,"Each new device is better than the last, this is no exception. I ran some benchmarks and the Galaxy S10+: for single and multi thread floating point it's far above the rest. For memory read it's also at the top, but memory write is relatively slower. On the storage, it's up at the top of the rankings.I'm not a hardcore gamer or power user. But I can tell that this is faster than all my other devices, and probably faster than my old PCs. It runs my kids favorite game Genshin Impact as smooth as butter and in high definition. It can download over my WiFi with as much speed as I have available.Physically this is surprisingly thin. The edges are a little sharp but you won't notice that when it's in a case. The screen is smooth to touch and feels similar to paper with the stylus. I was surprised to find that Samsung is still including a microSD option. I personally like that so I can move physical media. I have a USB-C docking station I use with my laptop. It connected right up with this tablet for charging, keyboard, and mouse, but not the monitors. I think that's on my dock and not the tablet.If you're looking for the latest tech with a large vibrant screen, this is your stop. It's so large, it could be a laptop replacement. But not as portable as a smaller device. Get a case and screen protector and you're set.",5,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/9/2024,"I am upgrading from an old Tab S6. This new one is better in almost every way. The only downside I see is actually one of its features: the size. This thing is really big. That's great most of the time, but I find the tab S10 to be harder to hold. With the S6 I can hold it with one hand by putting the tip of my pinky on one side and my thumb on the other.  This isn't very comfortable, but its doable. With the S10 there's no chance I can stretch my fingers out that far, so I'm left holding it at the edge with a finger on either side, which risks accidental clicks. The pen that sticks to the back is retarded, just like it was on the S6. For the S6 IU solved the issue by getting a case that has a groove for the pen.

10/10/2024,"This review has nothing to do with the hardware, technical etc. That has been done to overkill. That is not what sells me the product. I want to know what I can do with it. Once I know if it will allow me to do what I want then you sell me the hardware and technical.First, I am a die hard Kindle Fire Tablet fan. I have the Prime Video and other movie streaming, all my books, documents, etc. on my Fire Tablet. The stylus is attached to my tablet. Not so, this item.The stylus is loose and to me looks like cheap plastic. There is a section on the back of the tablet to attach it to charge, but it will fall off the back of the tablet. Since I put the tablet in the keyboard case, I need to figure out the attaching to charge side.Software. It is powered by Android. It was a breeze to set up. The QR code was scanned and my phone was copied over. The only thing I can't do is make phone calls unless I want to add it to my phone plan.  I don't. I have full access to the internet. The few apps that came with it are only free for trial then cost. I need to go to the play store and locate and pay and download any other apps that are compatible with Android. I hate that a program I use quite frequently on my PC that is free costs to download on this tablet. I cannot find good art/drawing/photo editing software or any 3D modeling software compatible that is affordable. For downloading material to read, well I have Kindle installed so I do have access to my library.I have the keyboard case. Still trying to figure out what to type in for any app I have or what to write in for that matter. I wanted to draw but am looking for software that I can download. I can't bring over what I already own on my PC. Is this important? Yes. I'm a creator in a game on the web. That's how I make a living. I was hoping this would give me more portability for work.  I use GIMP and Blender exclusively.  GIMP has a cost to download to Android. Blender is not available.Right now I don't feel the options are there fully software-wise. I have tried to locate any apps that I would find I want. Now, if you play games there are ton of them. I don't usually spend a lot of time playing games.I don't like the free trials that they put on gadgets. This is just a way to get you to buy them. You try them and forget and you wind up with a subscription or all your stuff created in that app now you have to buy it to have access to what you created.I am disappointed. I want to take my creations with me to work on. The software is not compatible with Android. Sadly it is with iPad and Kindle. Silly I know.I have had this less than a week so am still trying to find software I want. Will update if I have success.DISCLAIMER: This item was provided free of charge for review through the Amazon Vine Program.",3,Galaxy Tab S10+
10/8/2024,"I'll give you the TLDR up front: This is a good tablet, but the iPad Pro M4 line is just better for most as a consumption device.So I'm fortunate enough to have the 11"" iPad Pro M4 512GB, so this 12.4"" Galaxy Tab S10+ 512GB, while not as direct a competitor with this as with the 13"" iPad Pro M4, - aside from the screen sizes the iPads are identical in terms of performance. Given that, here's my comparison between the two from the perspective of a media consumption and general purpose tablet usage.1.) The packaging:This may not be the most important aspect of tablets (obviously), but there's still something really satisfying about ripping open a high-end device box, and, well, Apple has Samsung beaten here. The iPad Pro box is a couple of tabs on the top and bottom, and you're in. The wrapping of the tablet inside is easy to remove without tearing, and while Apple has removed a bunch of packaging waste from these boxes, the experience still feels good.The Samsung box? Well, maybe I just got unlucky? It's very similar in that there are two pull tabs, one top, one bottom. Great. However, they didn't separate as easily, leaving me to have to grab a box cutter to remove one. After I was in, I was greeted by the tablet in some kind of annoying baggie that you have to rip open. It was not an attractive procedure. Even then, after that, there's plastic film around every edge, and not in one continuous (satisfying) removal process. Nope, there's loads of tiny pieces of film, so it took several minutes to remove it all. I didn't enjoy this.2.) Setup process:This is probably a tie. Both device processes are pretty streamlined these days, and you can restore from an iPhone/iPad backup to the Tab S10+, - no issues there.3.) Hardware:This is a bit of a tricky one. Some things are unquestionably better on the Samsung, and some are unbeatable on the iPad Pro M4. The screen, for example. Apple's smaller Pro screen is 11"", 264ppi, 120hz, whereas this Samsung is 12.4"" at 266ppi, and also 120hz. Of course you can't tell the difference in ppi, but what was most apparent is that Apple's tandem OLED screen is ahead of the Samsung's. It's brighter (both at max brightness), punchier, more natural, and overall the much better experience. This was with the Samsung set to its Natural image profile, and the iPad defaults (True Tone on or off for testing, though). In all situations, the Apple screen just is better, but... the 12.4"" Samsung screen is unquestionably larger for movie watching due to the more movie-like aspect ratio along with the larger screen.The speakers? The Samsung is better, here. The M4 Pro iPads are a bit tinny, a result - one supposes, of the devices getting noticeably thinner over the prior models. The Samsung sounds more full. It's not a night and day difference, but the Apple devices this year just don't sound as good as they used to.Software:It's the whole Android vs iPadOS again. You like what you like. I tend to prefer iPadOS, having used both Android and iPadOS for a long time. It's smoother, more performant (this is likely due to Apple always having the fastest tablets), and just overall screen responsiveness is Apple all the way. The other annoyance I always have with Android tablets is 23.976hz playback. For example, when using Plex on both iPad Pro and the Tab S10+, it's obvious that the iPad is significantly smoother. I don't know if the Samsung doesn't support 5:5 pulldown at 120hz for proper 24p playback, but for whatever the reason, I can't ever seem to get smooth 24p from the Samsung, no matter what settings I used. The iPad Pro? Smooth as silk, - especially noticeable on camera pans, as it has been for years on these 24p-capable devices.Security:I like that Samsung has face unlock and fingerprint ID unlock. Both worked flawlessly for me straight out of the box. Apple only has FaceID. FaceID is more secure than the face unlock on Android, but either way, Samsung makes this more convenient with both currently implemented types of biometric securities here. The fingerprint sensor is under the display, so it's never in the way. Excellent.Performance:This is Samsung's fastest tablet yet (well, just), as the Tab S9+ was plenty fast in its own right. In day to day usage, you probably won't see much of a difference between the S9+ and S10+, but there's no question, the iPad Pro M4 has both beaten. It's just snappier in general, and gaming performance is better on the iPad Pro M4. I noticed hitches occasionally in even heavier web browsing on the Samsung that simply isn't there on the iPad. Additionally, both the iPad Pro M4 and this Samsung Tab S10+ were able to fully saturate my gigabit internet connection over WiFi 6E without issue, using Speedtest sites.Stylus support:After using the S Pen included with the Samsung and the Apple Pencil Pro (not included with the iPad), I find myself preferring the S Pen for MY uses. Even aside from the multitude of gestures the S Pen supports that Apple Pencil Pro never will, I just prefer how it feels to write on the screen. The Apple Pencil Pro always has that feeling of plastic on glass. I don't like how that feels, - it's not natural. The S Pen features a much softer tip, and it glides more easily. I also have an Amazon Kindle Scribe, and adore the way the Scribe stylus feels on the screen, and the Samsung, while not as good as the Scribe, just feels way better to use on the screen than the Apple Pencil Pro. The Pencil Pro still is fantastic, with more nuance to shading angle of the drawing etc, but the feel on the screen? S Pen all the way. Drawing latency is as close to flawless as you can imagine on both Samsung and Apple devices. Oh, and the S Pen is included with the Tab S10+, so it's nice not to have to make another purchase like you do with the iPad.Expansion and value:The Tab S10+ includes a microSD card slot. That is a big win for consumers, given how much it costs to add additional storage (internal only) on the Apple device. I mean, if you need a 2TB iPad Pro, you're spending a veritable fortune. For the Tab S10+, not so much. You buy a 512GB Tab S10+ and a 1.5TB microSD card, and you're away, - for far less than an iPad Pro with the equivalent storage. Sure, you don't get the raw speed of the internal storage of the iPad, but, if you don't need blazing speed but you do need reasonably fast storage - the Tab S10+ is better value here. That said, if money is no object, the iPad does offer larger, blazing fast storage options that Samsung simply doesn't. It's 256GB or 512GB with the Samsung, and no more.Which to get?If you're an Android fan, you get an Android tablet, and the Samsung is good. It's a bit of a lazy effort compared to last year's, with many of the same specs and cameras, battery capacity etc. But it's a good device. If you're all in on Apple, you get the iPad Pro, - it just makes the most sense to stick with what you're most comfortable with in terms of OS. I find iPadOS to be just a little more polished in general, and more user friendly if you're starting out with a new tablet for the first time.That said, if you're device agnostic, the choice is a little harder. The iPad Pro M4 is faster, yes, and the screen is better, - absolutely. But the value of the Samsung device is hard to argue, especially if you need more, cheap storage, and if you spend a lot of your time watching movies and want a larger screen, the 12.4"" Samsung is significantly larger than the 11"" iPad Pro for less money, especially when you factor in the included S Pen. For a 16:9 movie, it's about a 1/3 larger viewing area than the 11"" iPad Pro, which is significant! Versus the latest 13"" iPad Pro, the Samsung still offers a 2.23% larger screen for 16:9 content than the iPad.Overall, 4 out of 5. Good, but perhaps not as good as it could be.",4,Galaxy Tab S10+
11/23/2024,"I was excited to try the Galaxy Tab S10+ Plus, especially since I use both Apple and Android devices and wanted to explore what this tablet could offer. On paper, it seemed perfect: a stunning AMOLED 2X screen, ample storage, and the included S Pen made it an appealing package. Unfortunately, my experience was less than ideal. The packaging arrived damaged, with some ripped papers inside, which immediately gave a poor first impression for such a premium product.The tablet itself has a gorgeous display, and when it works, the visuals are vibrant and sharp, making it a pleasure to use for streaming and browsing. The S Pen feels natural and is great for sketching and jotting notes. However, the excitement quickly faded when I noticed a recurring issue with the keys sticking. Typing or navigating became frustrating, as certain keys required multiple presses to respond. For a device at this price point, such basic functionality should work flawlessly, and it’s disappointing to deal with these glitches right out of the box.The tablet does have its positives, like a long-lasting battery and solid durability. It handled multitasking well, and I appreciated features like Circle to Search and Sketch to Image, which added some creativity to the mix. But those features don’t fully make up for the aggravation of unreliable keys and the disappointing packaging experience. I ended up giving this to my daughter because it was just to annoying for meI wanted to love this tablet, and it’s clear there’s potential here, but the quality issues made it hard to justify the investment. At this price, I expected far more polish and reliability, especially from a brand like Samsung. While the concept and features are strong, the execution left a lot to be desired.",2,Galaxy Tab S10+

10/8/2024,It's a powerful device. It's everything you love about the iPad and it can do it all with ease. But.. the OLED screen on mine has an intolerable yellowish tint to it. The color white does not show up as white. Other colors particularly black text weirdly pop. It hurts my eyes. It gives me  headache. Yes I have tried turning true tone and night shift off. Yes I have endlessly tinkered with the tints under the accessibility settings. I want an iPad that looks more like my 2017 model iPad Pro 10.5 inch. I would happily downgrade to a regular iPad or iPad air but Amazon offers no way to return this. They force you to try manufacturer or product support instead. I highly resent that. I want to return this before this alleged return window has closed. Don't try to talk me out of it or treat me like an idiot who doesn't know how to use or rest the device. The seller is dishonest for saying it's returnable. I hope I figure something out with the display customization but right now I'm not happy. Other than the display it's great.,2,iPad Pro 11inch M4

Within a day and a half to two days, it needs to be recharged. It is a WiFi only model. The last Samsung tablet I had lasted all week on that amount of use. It still does. I tried putting it on airplane mode when not using it, didn’t make much of a difference.Picture quality is great, it functions like an Apple device does.

9/23/2024,I only got to play a few games of solitaire before it quit and I was never able to get the screen to work again.

7/14/2024,"So I’ve been using an iPad forever; since the very first original actually. I just got the M4 11 inch with 512 M.  I’m coming from the 10.5 inch 2nd Gen Pro from 10 years ago most recently.  Here is the short it…if you have the M1 or later there is zero reason to upgrade. My old one honestly was super fast, I really don’t see a speed difference for general use, few basic games, movies, surf, spreadsheets sheets,  and light video editing.Weight, basically the same can’t even tell.So why did I buy? When IOS 18 comes out in 2025 I wanted to be able to use he new technology my old would most likely not. I will say the sound quality Is much improved and the screen is better but not mind blowing like on your TV for an OLED.WHY U SHOULD GET THIS:1) Your old iPad is having issues or you broke it2) You use the pencil all the time and want the new features…I didn’t buy it3) Had limited space and need more4) Watch a lot of movies and the sound was driving you crazy with how bad it was5) You edit tons of videos and need raw powerWHY DONT GET IT1) You have Any iPad except the mini in the last 5 yeas especially pro you won’t see a speed difference if that’s the main factor2) You’re expecting a mind blowing screen over your previousI will say this….. the 13 inch is thinner than the 11 inch and even a tad heavier it feels lighter. I got the 11 only because I couldn’t justify the cost otherwise I would have got that. The sound for some reason is better on the 13 inch that 11 but still a massive improvement over my old one.",4,iPad Pro 11inch M4
8/24/2024,LOVE all the new features of this latest iPad Pro M4.  Great upgrade from my 2021 iPad Pro M1.Only minor disappointment is the Nanotech anti-glare coating on the screen.  YES it almost completely eliminates glare which is fabulous to eliminate glare from lights and windows.  However the Nanotech anti-glare coating is really difficult to keep it looking clean when the display is off... but once the display lights up it looks great!,4,iPad Pro 11inch M4
6/15/2024,"I have both the 11 and 13 M4 iPad Pro.  this is for the 11"" one.  I bought both from Apple as they have cellular as well.The 11"" is not as light (losing weight) as the 13.  The old 12.9 was a heavy tablet, especially when combined with the keyboard.  The 13"" M4 feels so much lighter and outside of being large is fairly easy to hold.  The thinness helps as well.  the 11"" is thin and that is great but the 11"" is a bit denser given its overall footprint.  Not heavy but not ""light"" compared to the last one.OLED:  The OLED panel is really nice.  It is clear and very very bright.  Almost hurt my eyes bright.  But outside or in well lit areas it really shines.  If you are sensitive to PWM as I am, be warned the 13"" feels a bit worse in this regard.  I think it may relate to its overall size as the 11"" is just a smaller footprint the specs are the same so in theory it should bother your eyes the same.  I can use the iPhone 15 Pro Max just fine, the IPP 11 is decent in this regard but I cannot use it for hours and the 13"" is a bit worse in terms of noticing the flicker.M4: Its nice but the software really gimps the whole iPad experience.  And no I don't expect MacOS to be on an iPad but iPad OS is kind of disappointing in that Stage Manager, Files, etc are just not that great.  And it appears Apple with iPad OS18 isn't doing too much to remedy that.  I believe that Apple uses the IPad Pro line to try out new technologies and work out the kinks in a relatively smaller population of users before bringing the tech to the Mac or other platforms.  What other way could explain the lack of software focus but having top notch hardware.  So just understand it's a tablet and not much more.  But it's a great tablet!Keyboard: The new Magic Keyboard is amazing!  It's probably one of the best parts of the new experience.  It stinks you have to pay such high amounts again but the keyboard is fantastic.  The weight is slightly less than the old one, but he materials are top notch, typing experience is good and the larger trackpad (particularly on the 13"") is very helpful.  I highly recommend the keyboard if you are trying to get any work done but overall it is just so nice and adds to the experience. It's a shame it is so expensive.Overall I think the M4 is a great iPad, but understand its limits the software is meh for any type of productivity beyond basic stuff.  For consumption is amazing but the price is quite high for this potential use case.  It is very thin and light and the keyboard is amazing.  Overall it's a great package if you have the funds to invest and want the best experience with an iPad.  If you are sensitive to flickering, though, I recommend you try it out in a store first or get it from a place with a good return policy just in case.",5,iPad Pro 11inch M4
1/7/2025,"It came on time (I guess early considering the Cyber Monday) and in amazing condition, it has no scratches. Set up was smooth and fast. Charger was included but NO genuine iPhone products.

1/6/2025,"I bought this iPhone 13 128GB Starlight, and since it’s a renewed product, I was quite nervous when I first ordered it. However, when it was delivered, it was amazing. The exterior was in good condition, the frame was nice with no scratches, and even the back and camera worked well. After setting up the phone, I checked everything and was very satisfied to find that the screen hadn’t been replaced, it’s the original screen. Overall, everything is great. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the battery capacity is only at 85%. If it were higher, it would definitely deserve 5 stars. But for a renewed product, this is already excellent",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
12/26/2024,Listen guys I was hesitant in ordering this phone but I did . There was a delay with the delivery and I contacted the company and they were very helpful and ensured I got my package on time . Phone is clean and is working well so far. BUY IT!!!

1/10/2025,"FYI if you have an eSIM card on your old iPhone like I did holy crap. So unbelievably simple to transfer service (NOT DATA) to your new phone. Like press a couple buttons on both phones simple. And no getting permission from the account holder if you are on a family plan. Data, ya that’s simple too, as long as you back up your old phone over the cloud or onto a computer. And no bullshit Verizon charges for a “new” SIM card or waiting there! Seriously I’ll never buy a phone another way (yes, I always buy my phones outright, personal preference).Technical details aside, the phone was listed in excellent condition and it is, one or two small dings to the metal sides but otherwise perfect. 80% battery health (which lasts longer than my 2nd generation SE at 92%). I did not realize the seller was sending by FedEx signature required, but luckily it was able to go pick it up at the local shipping center. Packaged securely, no damage in transport.Highly recommend.",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
1/21/2025,The phone is in excellent physical condition and that’s where it ends.That a phone is considered in excellent condition with a battery capacity under 90% is ridiculous.This phone came to me with 85% battery capacity.  Apple suggests replacing batteries once their capacity is under 80% so I’m going to need to replace the battery in a matter of months. This isn’t “excellent” at all.In the future I’ll just spend the extra money on a brand new phone.,3,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

1/8/2025,"At first I was kind of skeptical with this product since it was refurbished, but I really liked it! It’s good for the price. It was like it was brand new! And it is indeed an apple product. Not a scam. My only problem was that I ordered it December 17, 24’ and it didn’t get here until January 7th 25’. Probably because it was Christmas.And don’t forget, your SIM card probably won’t work UNLESS the phone has the same carrier. I had to go in store to purchase me a SIM card for 30$. Overall 10/10.

I got ready to put my screen protector on today but then noticed there was a screen protector already on which was odd but I guess it's a plus. I looked at the battery health, and it's currently at 80% Battery Health. I don't think it's overall a bad deal for a refurbished phone. I usually get refurbished phones from Amazon and always have a positive experience. If you're looking to get a budget friendly phone, this is your sign to get it!",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

12/10/2024,I received a good price on this iPhone 13 considering I took advantage of the Amazon store card and got 80.00 off the price. I’m very pleased with my renewed iPhone 13. It only had a very small scratch on the screen.  It was cricket locked which I have cricket service. I switched over the  old phones data etc. with no problem. I was able to keep my original phone number. iPhone sold at cricket wireless are very expensive. They wanted 699.00 with keeping my old number. I paid 240.00 for renewed for the same phone..

8/23/2024,"So let me start out by saying that I am not one to purchased refurbished phones and whenever something would happen to one of mine and I had to turn it into the Phone company and they would send me a refurbished one to replace mine, there was always something wrong with them. So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

Within 30 minutes my new iPhone 13 was a mirror image of my old 8Plus, with newer features like facial recognition all good to go.  The only minor fly in the ointment is the battery health, which read 86%, a number firmly within the guidelines of 80 -90% as stated by Amazon.

I would probably go back with Android, just because of the familiarity with the functions. Other than that, so far so good for an excellent grade refurbished iPhone. I did take out the extended warranty as I have never bought refurbished before.",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
12/22/2024,"My daughter has been aging my nerves over an Iphone for Christmas! I was not going to buy a new one, but instead decided to do a ""trial"" with a used one! This phone  came in excellent condition. Al I did was pop the sim card out of her old Cricket phone and placed it in the Iphone. Worked like a charm. I am super pleased with this product! Thank you 100%! I will have one happy daughter on Christmas day.",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
11/5/2024,"Fast shipping and product as expected other than I got the wrong color. Ordered a red phone, got a blue one. I didn't return it, as the medium blue color was nice looking, and I needed the phone asap.  Fortunately, the specs/memory were the same 256GB.  Phone had some dings on the edges of the body, but they all disappeared once I put a case on it. I didn't expect it to be 100% and a few dings were worth the better price.",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
1/18/2025,"This phone arrived in one day, and in the condition it was listed as (or better!) battery health is higher than I expected. Great trustworthy company to do business with!",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
11/19/2024,Haven’t had any problems with the phone. They do not refurbish the battery mine was on 86% when I got it. Had a few minor scratches on the sides but nothing major. It did come with a screen protector already on it which was nice. It was carrier unlocked as advertised. Only reason I didn’t give it a 5 star was the battery.,4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
8/21/2024,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

7/28/2024,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
11/10/2024,"The phone's in good shape.  Everything seems to work.  85% battery life, same as everyone else has reported.The charging cord arrived cut almost in half.  Its little sealed bag was undamaged, as was the packaging of the phone, suggesting the cord was cut sometime prior to bagging.  Every wire had been severed.",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
1/10/2025,88 percent battery life screen and glass back panel appears new some minor scuffs on silver side bezel.  Just hoping there will be no issues with the phone down the line,5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
10/23/2024,"The phones are great the only problem is I got one with 90% battery and the other with 80% battery. The one with 80% dies at 10% that’s the only problem and the one with 90% is good no problem. Got them with no scratches they look brand new, I have no problem charging them and I don’t use the charger they came with I use Apple Original charger.",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

1/8/2025,Although the iPhone 13 was not new it was in great shape and it worked great. Very good value for the money. Well worth its price. Was very satisfied with it,5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

    For buying a used phone it’s pretty OK I guess but the only problem that I have with it is, I wish it came with a better battery capacity. After reading some other reviews on here, there’s people that paid for good condition versus excellent and they got a better battery. I would prefer to have a better battery so that way I can make sure the device will last for a couple years for my daughter overall it’s functional it does what it’s supposed to and it’s gonna have a case on it so I’m not really concerned about little minor scratches. I also purchased the Asurian protection plan to go with it just in case there’s any problems because Amazon offers it for five dollars a month with the purchase order so far so good. I’m only giving it three stars because of the battery. I was hoping to get a better capacity.",3,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

12/12/2024,"I was desperately in need of a new phone and was skeptical of buying a used phone, but the price compared to a new one seemed worth giving it a shot. The phone was marked as in ""excellent"" condition and I would say it is, there are only a few very minor nicks in areas you would expect but even those are unseen once you put a case on it. So far everything seems to be working perfectly.",5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is. Good product, terrible delivery.",3,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
1/4/2025,Telefono en muy buen estado lo recomiendo,5,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
11/23/2024,"As I am strapped for money, I decided to go the refurbished route in hopes of saving a few dollars since Apple got rid of the monthly card installments for an unlocked phone. When I first opened the box, I noticed it was in excellent physical condition. Almost perfect. I definitely had high hopes for this phone from the get go. Unfortunately, I immediately started having issues once I connected it. It started freezing, I couldn't access my settings or voicemail, and my battery life was already at 85%. I restarted the phone and it worked for about 30 minutes before I started having issues again. While on the charger, at about 90% charged, it turned off on me a twice while I was using it. It didn't automatically turn back on so I had to turn it on again both times. I figured that wasn't a huge problem and would contact Amazon customer service in the morning if it did it again however I started having more problems. Had to make a quick trip to the store and thats when I noticed that as soon as I got in the car and was no longer connected to wifi, it immediately just went to ""No Service"". I would restart it and when it turned on, it would work for a about 3-5 minutes but then would go back to ""No Service"". Fortunately, I knew where I was if not I definitely would have been lost at night. After I got home, I restarted a couple more times but it wouldn't connect to my cellular data anymore or work t all unless I was connected to WIFI. As I stated previously, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, looks like I got a defective phone but I can't risk or deal with the chance of getting another refurbished phone with problems so I decided to go and ahead and return the phone. I literally had to run to to Best Buy 15 minutes before they closed to buy a new phone because unfortunately in this day and age, you can't be without a phone. Hopefully this is a good alternative for someone else, but I did not get that lucky.",2,"iPhone 13, 128GB"
5/1/2024,"I’ve had this phone since April 11th and I could say it’s a pretty good phone , it works as it’s supposed to, the only thing bad about this phone is that it came with minor scratches ! But don’t worry the scratches weren’t that bad and you could honestly barely even tell unless you really are looking deeply into the phone. It was also to be expected since it’s refurbished versus if the phone was brand spanking new it would have zero scratches. But if I were to purchase a brand new phone overtime I would have had scratches on the phone anyways so it didn’t bother me as much. I wanted to wait to give it a review to see how things were for me but overall it’s a fair purchase for a used phone, it would have gotten a 5/5 only because it did come a little dirty around the bottom microphone part but a good wipe and it was good! It’s now June and I’ve had it for 3 months and nothing I mean absolutely nothing is wrong with this phone!",4,"iPhone 13, 128GB"

Their excellent customer service made the process completely stress-free.My son absolutely loves his new phone! It’s been a hit with him, both for its performance and its style.

I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",1,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
1/21/2025,"I would 100% recommend this. Phone came early in a really good condition Battery health was 86%, sound, camera was good as well. Camera acts funny (especially front) sometimes to be completely honest but to be fair, it’s not brand new and I know that I can’t really expect it to be perfect. Overall I’d rate a 9/10 at the time of reviewing this product(I just got it). I’d post an update if I notice any issues in the future.",5,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
12/14/2024,"Ordered a phone in good condition. According to Amazon there isn’t supposed to be any scratches on the screen when it is in good condition. There are 2 deep scratches and smaller scratches on the screen. Not upset about it but it doesn’t follow what Amazon says. Battery was at 100% health so It makes up for the scratches. But i am a bit disappointed in that there were scratchesBesides that the phone is in good condition, was a bit of scuff marks on the side but a case hid that. The speakers are loud, was fully unlocked and was able to switch it over to my carrier easily. Was worried when I saw reviews saying the phone wasn’t unlocked but I didn’t have that issue.Overall I’m happy with the phone, just the scratches were disappointing.",4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
11/30/2024,"I ordered the unlocked 256gb midnight iPhone14 from MCESALES. At first my flash, flashlight nor cameras were working, but everything else was perfectly fine. I contacted the seller who gave me a few tips to try and everything worked! Now my phone is PERFECT. NO scratches ANYWHERE, it transferred everything easily, cameras now work and the battery capacity is at 100%. This is the best phone ever for the price I paid!😅 Also, MCESALES has great customer service! Their response was quick and my problem was resolved in a day’s time.👌",5,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
12/10/2024,"Made my 15yr old daughter got a job, saved her money, and bought this phone (I’m 43, got my first phone at 17, and my mother didn’t buy it!) She got it activated today. Condition was excellent upon arrival. So far she’s very happy👍🏽 Camera works fine, flashlight, WiFi, speakers sound good, screen is clear of scratches. Seems pretty solid so far.",5,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
12/20/2024,"Shipping was fast for the phone and I liked the way it was packaged. It came with an acceptable charger. The phone looks like new but has a few scratches on the back. The quality of the phone and screen is nice. Overall, for an amazon renewed iPhone everything was good.",5,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
1/6/2025,"I purchased this as I wanted a newer phone and this seemed a less expensive way to go. I was a refurbished iPhone 14. It came in a nice box and a charger cable, but not a charger. Not usually a problem as most people over time accumulate several them over time. It looked brand new and works fine. Unfortunately, I had assumed that refurbished meant “like new”, but apparently it also means “it was checked out, cleaned up and it works”. What it does not mean is a new battery. Mine had a battery with 84% charge capacity. In fairness, the company’s fine print indicates this so that’s on me to have overlooked that. In fairness I did get a “newer” phone just not one that was “like new” which meant like a new one, not just close. So, the iPhone is a newer one and works well, just will not hold a charge as long. If that doesn’t matter then this a good choice.",4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
10/28/2024,"The seller is great, we had to send back the first phone because we thought it was defective, it turned out that there is a significant conflict with the portability of the old phone information and 18.0.1 upgrade.  When we cut on the phone we set it up to transfer the old phone material first, then it wanted to upgrade the software prior to the transfer.  The upgrade spooled around for 18 hrs, then the portability function (over WiFi and Cloud) simply would not work.  AT&T couldnt figure it out....we sent the phone back thinking it was defective (turns out it was fine), got a new phone same model, etc.New phone had the same issues, and I was thinking at this point it cannot be coincidence so it must me a software conflict.  And....it was.  After MUCH tinkering with it here is the workaround for those of you who are in the same situation (as an aside, we were upgrading my wife's ancient XE to a 14 but I think this happens with a lot of phones no matter the model)1.  Cut on the new phone2.  Opt to NOT set up the new phone with the old phone (ie, do NOT transfer the old phone data yet).3.  Go to settings, opt to update the software to 18.0.14.  After this, ERASE the phone.  It will keep 18.0.1 on there, it will remove any impediments to port over the information.5.  KEEP the e-sim information on there(it gives you that option when you erase, it is ok not to do it but you will have to put it back on so just keep it on).6.  Boot the phone back up7.  OPT to set it up with the old phone (likely the older phone will prompt you for this first).8.  You can set it up over Wifi or Cloud, make sure you have backed up the old phone on the cloud just before set up if you opt for that.9.  There is an option to use direct cabling to transfer, but it is a pain because Apple insists on using the proprietary cabling they have, so it means you have to first port everything onto a laptop then transfer it.  Safer but not any quicker.  I would not do that unless you have cloud issues and/or bad WiFi.Phone has worked great since we did the workaround, and I want to compliment the seller as they were quick to send a replacement phone to us and very communicative on the issues.  I hope the workaround here helps others, it was utterly baffling to us.  Apple needs to get it together on the portability issues since they just released the new model and apparently this is an issue with a number of older to newer transfers, very disappointing for them to not catch this.",5,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
1/7/2025,"Pretty much the most important thing about an iPhone that matters more than a camera, some scratches, and even the overall iPhone is, and will always be, the battery percentage.Mine is 88% for the excellent condition. I just hope this lasts, as I bought it for use in Peru and not the states. So, charging your phone is a whole lot less convenient when not in the US, surrounded by chargers and plugs/outlets.I will update this within a few months to see the battery life and how it will hold up.Other than that, it looks great; it even got a USB-A cable + charger box, which is a plus.",4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
12/12/2024,"Phone arrived packaged nicely and included charging cube and cord.  I had to present my drivers license and sign for it when FedEx delivered it.  Some scratches on the sides, but front and back screen look new.  Very disappointed however to check the battery health and it only be at 85%.  I would have thought that an “excellent, like new” phone would’ve came with a new battery since that has always been my experience with Apple refurbished products. (I do realize this is not a certified Apple refurbished product) I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, so no time to return and get a different phone.  For the price paid, I would’ve expected a “like new” phone that has a new battery.",4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
1/7/2025,Will update with pictures. Overall the phone is nice and works great. No scratches or chips. The battery life is at 88% which isn’t a huge deal for me I’m home a lot and have the time to keep it charged. The sides were very obviously painted. You can see it on the back and front glass. But other than a little bit of cosmetics and the battery life I would 100% recommend this!,4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
12/14/2024,Ordered just the basic quality level !!Had very mixed feelings about ordering because it’s like you just gotta be one the lucky ones ones to get a good one so I rolled the dice being cheap bastered I am but I love quality at same time haha I got lucky my iPhone 14 was in mint condition only problem was battery life in settings said 82 percent I’ve had the phone nearly 3 months now that hasn’t changed it charges to 100 percent every time and last long time but it dies at 4 percent life everything else perfect and I ordered just the basic cheapest quality level !!,4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"

After that, all was good. Probably operator (me) not phone.",5,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
10/6/2024,"All of this was experienced in the span of about 24-48 hours, and due to my work, I couldn’t keep the device because of the performance issues experienced:I needed a phone quick because my last phone died. While I appreciate the quick turn around on my order and delivery, the device had issues.For starters, the refurbished one I ordered and received took a long time to set up. You couldn’t just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. If you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline never changed.I reached out to apple and they helped me get it set up, however, there were several performance issues with the device I received.Total time it took to get the phone set up: 6.5 hours.Details: Started at 4pm as soon as the device was delivered, and after seeing the update was still not completed around 9pm, I worked with Apple support to get the device finally set up around 10pm.Performance issues:The charging port was loose, so even if the device was connected to a plug in charger, it wouldn’t always charge. This also impacted connection to CarPlay when driving. The phone would be sitting in the seat beside me, plugged in, but if it moved slightly, the connection wouldn’t work and I’d have to unplug it and plug it back in. It’s not tight enough to keep a good connection.There was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. If you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn’t register. At times the screen wouldn’t respond at all, or if it was face down and I picked it up, I would see it was randomly typing characters in the Home Screen search box. I would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop.There was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. The camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. The sensor wouldn’t always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night I had it.The physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. While I don’t care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone I received was more along the lines of poor condition overall.For this seller, I think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. You should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work.Overall, with the issues and hassle I experienced with the device I was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local Best Buy.",2,"iPhone 14, 128GB"

Other than that, I’m Impressed with the phone being so clean, coming with a charger, and carefully packaged. Overall the phone was  definitely NOT in excellent “like new” condition. I’d say it was good, if any more dings it’d be “fair” at best. I’m accepting it as my homeboy was still grateful and bought this because he didn’t want me to spend too much on him.

    I definitely would recommend this phone.. But with that being said i will lay out the good and the bad of it.Good:- I ordered excellent and the phone came with absolutely no damage, scratches or anything. looked like a brand new phone.- Speakers work perfect- Camera works perfect- phone runs very smoothlyBad:- phone wouldn’t let me transfer from my old phone, could easily be that my old phones an iphone 11 and not as high tech- if you use straight talk, you can NOT do esim. went through hell to get my data transferred.- phone would not let me connect to imessage at first, all i had to do was turn off imsg, power it off and back on and it started working.- battery life is at 88%. but i also knew the risk when i bought the phone.I will definitely say that the phone is amazing and i’m very glad i made the purchase, considering how i was very hesitant to purchase as it’s from Amazon and refurbished. I would recommend purchasing this phone. with that being said i advise if you’re looking to purchase this phone you do!!!",4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"

10/5/2024,It’s all well the only problem is the screen. It looks like it’s indented or pushed in it’s kind of weird but whenever I’m in the phone it doesn’t affect how it works and it looks normal. It only looks bad when I turned the phone off.,4,"iPhone 14, 128GB"
12/16/2024,"For the most part the phone is good except for the screen. I don’t know if it was replaced before they sold it, but there’s a lag or disconnect when typing - not every letter button registers being touched, making typing very slow because you have to retype and go back to every other word. It’s very frustrating. Also the bottom speaker (right side) came very clogged/dirty. I want to give 4 stars but typing is extremely important with smartphones, so this issue complicates almost every interaction I have using my phone.",3,"iPhone 14, 128GB"

To date, I am completely satisfied.The product arrived well-packaged, including the charger and instruction booklet. Specific positive attributes include: 1) excellent battery life; 2) verification as a genuine Apple product with matching specifications; 3) a bright and vibrant color; 4) compatibility with a universal stylus (purchased separately for cost savings); 5) a responsive processor and touchscreen; 6) rapid charging capabilities with the included fast charger; 7) absence of visible scratches or damage; and 8) overall excellent value. 9) Delivery was prompt, adhering to the advertised timeframe.In summary, I highly recommend this product.P.S.

1/11/2025,"This was purchased to replace my son’s 7 year old iPad. I bought yellow because it’s a unique color and more likely to stand out, meaning less people would have the yellow version. The color isn’t quite the yellow I was expecting. In fact my 8 year old son was stoked that he got a “gold” iPad. It does look gold-ish. Battery life is great, lasts all day, and charging is the easy usb-c connection. I was able to get the iPad set up and linked with his Apple Watch and our family account very easily and this iPad has very useful parental controls. The quality and value is unmatched. Both our kids have this same iPad in different colors. 10/10 recommend.",5,iPad 10th Gen

Procreate works pretty well though, worth the 13 bucks extra.",4,iPad 10th Gen
1/1/2025,"I bought this small iPad specifically for travel but I use it for reading at home. I wanted a place to transfer my travel photos from my phone so they were more accessible, could be enlarged, and I could use them in my daily trip journal. It was also very useful in place of heavy books so I had interim entertainment and was able to research while traveling. I prefer the larger screen to a phone-sized screen. I chose an iPad in a bright color so it would be visible and not easily taken in error or theft. It was portable, easily accessible, and met my needs.",5,iPad 10th Gen
10/30/2024,"Warning!  Read this first!Look for the asterisks in the text below.  Read that area first before clicking on the buy button!My iPad 9th generation has served me well for the past few years but the battery life was beginning to suffer and the screen had a few scratches from daily use.I could have had the battery replaced, but that seemed to average around $100 and that was a no-go, especially since I was offered just $90 on trade in so spending more just didn’t make sense.Now Apple wants $349 for the base 64GB unit but I’ve noticed that many stores have reduced the price to $299, possibly because Apple has discontinued sales of the 9th generation and supplies are starting to dry up.So, I jumped at the chance to get a newer version.  I’ve been a good boy this year and saved my money so I could afford this.I got mine in yellow since the better half has hers in pink.  No confusing these two.One thing you’ll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimensions are not much different from the earlier generation.However, looks can be deceiving.  The screen goes from 10.2 inches to 10.9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom.And that begs the question, how do I close out apps without pressing that button?The android way, that’s how. You slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them (or choose the one you want to use).Those of you using iPhones know this procedure well.Yet another question I’ve been asked - where’s the fingerprint ID if the button is gone?It’s now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner.I’d love to tell you that setup was a snap but I’d be lying.******This iPad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old iPad.  Thought I had a dud.Called Apple and they discovered this one  was lacking updates from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing.  Since my old iPad was already on 18.1, it was trying to force apps and settings to a new iPad that couldn’t readily take it.Mind you, Apple verified this was indeed a brand new iPad and not a refurb or customer return.  It had just been sitting around in a warehouse for nearly 2 years.So, in short, you’ll have to do updates first, and then transfer from your old iPad.And how do you do that?* Sign in to your Apple account.* Instead of allowing transfer from your iCloud or other iPad, tell it you want to do things manually.* At that point it’ll do the updates as required.* Then you reset the iPad and start over; however, once the updates are installed they stay forever.  Now transferring from either the cloud or your open iPad should be a breeze.  A two hour breeze.Plan on plugging it in, too.  You'll suck at least 30% of your battery doing just this procedure.*****Now back to the review.Overall operations are not drastically different from what I could see; however, I don’t use my iPad for heavy duty artistic work nor do I play intense games.  For Joe or Jane Everyday, this iPad won’t present any significant performance changes.How about the screen?  Looks about the same to me.Battery life?  Improved over my old tablet only because that battery was on its way out, but only time will tell if it is substantially better.I will give points to Apple, though, for finally going to a USB-C charger instead of the Lightning variety.  I was getting tired of lugging different chargers around.Now comes the last question - is this iPad worth the extra cost when you can still (possibly) find iPad 9s for $100 less?Yes and no.  Yes, if you can get this model for $299 at which point it’s just $50 more than the 9th generation, comes with a bigger screen, and uses the readily accepted USB-C charger.No, if you have to pay full retail of $350 or so.  At that point you might want to live with the Lightning charger and button at the bottom.",4,iPad 10th Gen
1/9/2025,"Purchased this as a 61st birthday gift to myself. Just as with every Apple purchase I’ve ever bought, completely satisfied and worth the money. I just wish Amazon had a feature that if you make a major purchase and there is a price difference (lower) w/i the 30-day return period, that your account is automatically credited the difference.The price dropped twice and I thought the Black Friday/ Cyber Monday would be the best time to purchase. However w/i two weeks of purchasing I had to call Amazon and ask for the price difference to be adjusted.It got to the point where I had to almost argue with the customer service representative that it’s okay, I’ll just return it and re-purchase it for the lower price. Then you will have to re-price the one I return for an even lower price b/c I used it.What’s up Amazon!",5,iPad 10th Gen
1/15/2025,"Fast review ,The updated charging plug is  game changer, the old ones were horrible . The iPad is FAST, wifi receiver is amazing. Battery life is better than the older models but not as good as the other reviews say , but it’s better than the older iPads. I was instantly happy with this purchase. Well made , screen is great for those with bad eyes . Touch ID is good, for those that love the home button you will get used to it the slightly different set up in a few minutes , this allows for a bigger screen too. Best $300 I have spent in a LONG time you get a lot for the money. If I had to pick from only a lap top pc and a iPad I’m taking this iPad .",5,iPad 10th Gen
1/20/2025,"I recently purchased the iPad 10, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and crystal clear, which is ideal for watching videos or reading eBooks. I bought the blue version and it is very beautiful. Besides,The packaging was also excellent. The iPad arrived in perfect condition, securely packed to ensure there was no damage during delivery. On top of that, the shipping was incredibly fast! I received my order much sooner than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise.",5,iPad 10th Gen
1/11/2025,"It’s a typical Apple product and quality is as expected. Once you get used to an Apple product it’s hard to move to Android. We brought it for our 5 yr old so she can use it instead of an iPhone to watch videos. Main benefit being the bigger screen. She definitely likes it better than the tablet we brought her before. In terms of appearances, the pink is a bit too bright pink but then it doesn’t matter because we put a protective cover over it anyways. I don’t quite like the edges. It makes sense for an iPhone so it’s easier to hold in one hand, but I don’t understand it for an iPad. I prefer the edges of the older version ones. Battery life and charging is fine for now but we’ll know later how well that stays.",4,iPad 10th Gen
12/12/2024,"I was initially hesitant to buy the Apple iPad (10th Generation) because of the 64GB storage, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised—it’s been more than enough for my needs. To conserve space, I removed all messages from the iPad and store my photos in the cloud, and it’s worked perfectly.  I have over 20gb free right now.After debating which iPad to purchase, I chose this one because it was on sale, and I’m so glad I did. It has far exceeded my expectations! The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp detail, making it perfect for watching movies, reading, or even sketching. The display alone feels like a major upgrade compared to my old Macbook.This iPad has made me more productive, creative, and organized:I’ve fully embraced being a digital planner girlie, and I love how easy it is to stay on top of my tasks.I’m exploring my artistic side with Procreate, and the A14 Bionic chip keeps everything smooth and responsive.Customizing my home screen to be aesthetically pleasing has been so much fun, and it really adds a personal touch.The versatility of this device is incredible. I found apps to help me budget my bills, write notes, and even convert my handwriting into text. I purchased an off-brand stylus and a paper-like screen protector, which makes writing and drawing feel natural—like using pen and paper. Honestly, I had no idea an iPad could do so much!Battery life has been a non-issue for me; I charge it every night with my phone, and it easily lasts all day. It’s so useful that I just bought a second one for my 5-year-old, who keeps stealing mine.If I could change one thing, it would be that I wish I had purchased an iPad sooner. This is hands down my favorite purchase this year. Whether for productivity, creativity, or just fun, the iPad 10th Generation delivers beyond expectations. If you’re on the fence—just go for it. You won’t regret it!",5,iPad 10th Gen

1/23/2025,I love my 10th gen ipad. I got the pink which is so cute and the product was basically brand new even tho it was labeled as used.

10/18/2024,"My only experience in using Apple was the Apple II in the early 80's.  I found that support the Apple way is what I have looked for in technical support.  When you setup an iPad make sure you document every field you enter - Label also.  If you enter an email name for the Account and you forget that email name you are close to saying goodby to the iPad, I did forget what email name I entered, and Apple Support was GREAT in helping me to process the unit like it came from the factory.Remember Amazon satisfy Apple that the unit you had purchased has been reset to factory default, if you entered an email name and forget what it is then you cannot clear that out and Apple thinks you are using the unit and if you want to return the Apple unit you can't, this means you have lost your money.  Kinda simple...Well, I could not remember the email name I used, did I write it down or setup a record in my password list.  I looked in all my trash cans for maybe a note, could not find anything.  I use a data wallet, and it has worked but you have to keep the data - I went through my last copies of the backups for the wallet and when I got back to the DATE, I received the iPad I saw an item for iPad - I made sure I had a good paper copy, loaded the current version of wallet data and started setup of iPad again.  It worked!Thanks to the support people at Amazon, Apple and Best Buy (they support Apple).  Maybe I will try a MAC???",5,iPad 10th Gen

(M4) model. Why did I also get this one? I'm a power user, but also do a lot of reading. I didn't want to wear out the OLED display with stationary screens even if it's got technology to delay that.So, seeing this one for $259, it was a no brainer. How did I find this iPad (10th generation) after owning the latest and greatest one? You'd be happy to know I was just as excited.It didn't feel like a lesser iPad upon unboxing and powering it up. The sense of ocassion was just as big. 😁Besides the OLED blacks, high refresh rate and extra brightess, the display on this base model iPad looks just as nice and as crisp compared side by side.Smaller black areas look inky. It's only in big ones that the LCD blacks don't look deep. It's a very nice display, even without the lamination of pricier iPad models. Jt's as pixel dense, and graphics pop off the screen.Power-wise, its A14 Bionic chip is what powered the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It's a slower variant, but still a powerhouse in 2024.This is not a shintzy, stuttery tablet, is what I'm saying. For $259 this Black Friday season for the 64GB Wi-Fi version, this is the best deal on an iPad, and you won't be missing out on much in the grand scheme.Unless you really want a specific feature of the iPad Pro, this base iPad will do everything that one does. I'm very giddy I own it, and will definitely use it more than my iPad Pro.Got it in pink for me, and got a blue one for my sister, which made her cry of happiness when I gave it to her yesterday.Why do I mention that? Her daily phone is Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Regardless of her being used to its bright, high refresh rate AMOLED display and powerful chip, she doesn't mind the iPad's LCD display  and older chip one bit.",5,iPad 10th Gen

Windows is not perfect but it still serves me in business simply because it’s a more open platform than Apple. Once I started down the iPad path I finally found my perfect companion. I now use iPads in business and keep iPads around home. So easy to use and the build quality is excellent. I don’t yet have a iPad Pro as my standard iPads do the job. One older iPad mini 4, a little underpowered but small. This latest model is an upgrade to the 7th gen which I still use daily. The iPad Air from last year is more powerful than this latest 10 gen iPad, but I usually don’t need the extra juice. Great price performance. Just get it.",5,iPad 10th Gen

12/1/2024,"The size is great, keys are easy to press, and the trackpad is awesome. Opening the iPad is a tiny bit difficult and screen moves easily, but I love how you can position the top screen half however you like it.  You can turn it backwards and set it against the keyboard and luckily there are little rubber pieces on the keyboard to keep the screen half from slamming into the keyboard. Would definitely recommend as a keyboard/trackpad, keyboard case. *Note* I am also able to have a screen protector on the front of the iPad without it affecting closing the case all the way….Photos: keyboard size compared to the Dexcom 7 reader and then the little rubber pads I mentioned…I hope this review helps someone out there who is looking for a keyboard case with trackpad. 😁Only thing I was bummed about was that I asked for the Midnight Amethyst and they sent Black instead.",5,iPad 10th Gen

It was generally easy to set up, but there really isn't an ""owners manual"" that goes into detail on what some of the features are and what some of the on-screen symbols are.  But that's just the way Apple does things!  It is larger than my old Gen 5 unit and somewhat lighter.  Right now I think I'm on the internet, but there is no ""internet symbol"" in the upper right hand corner as on my iPhone or old iPad.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the unit.",4,iPad 10th Gen

Although whenever I'm like playing a game and the iPad is sideways, I've noticed that the iPad volume button is the opposite like the top button turns the volume down and the bottom one turns it up, But it's not really a big deal to me.

If your connecting it to a PC your going to need to buy a USB C to USB adapter. Not a big deal but it would have been nice if they included one in the box. They're inexpensive.I have to say though that I have an 2nd generation ipad that I purchased 10 years ago and still working! I bought the 10th generation ipad to replace it because it can't be upgraded anymore.Bottom line.

10/13/2024,I was a little nervous about receiving this iPad but I’m honestly glad I made the purchase. It works very well and it’s so much better than the last one I had. It’s compatible with the 1st gen Apple Pencil but it works well with a 1st gen pencil from amazon as well. I got the iPad plus the accessories for $378.00 in total which to me is a good deal considering how much it would be in stores. If your not trying to spend to much but also want an apple branded product then I totally recommend you to buy this.. It came in the box unopened and also came with a fast charging adaptor and power cord as well.

Does split screen apps. Has the squared off edges. Slippery, it fell out of my hand within the first hour of holding it. It's heavy for its size.

12/9/2024,"I will be back to update this review in a few weeks as I grow more familiar with the tablet, but my initial impressions were so good that I had to make an immediate review.  I purchased this as an upgrade to a Lenovo M9 that I used for running laser engravers, as well as productivity with the Office365 suite, and for media consumption via music and movies.  I did not use it for gaming beyond RuneScape and Solitaire.  The M9 was a great price and I felt met all my needs perfectly.  The only reason I decided to upgrade to the M11 was for screen real estate.  The active stylus seemed like it would be a nice bonus for my graphics design work through the numerous apps I used in laser engraving. All that being said, as you can see I don't need the absolutely highest performance device on the market.As I've only used this tablet for 1 day, here are my observations.  It is a hefty boi.  It is surprisingly heavy, but not so much that I consider it a nuisance to hold.  That probably comes from the premium design, as the smaller bezels and aluminum body give you a feeling that you're using something that was designed with pride.The size itself is perfect for my needs. As the larger screen size makes it a lot easier to design things without constantly having to zoom out.  The included case is actually surprisingly slim, adding very little bulk.  I appreciate that.  It even has a rubber strap on it that you can use to either aid in carrying the tablet or secure the case closed during travel.So with regards to both the M9 and my new M11, one area that does impress me for such an affordable tablet is the screen.  I really appreciate the colorful display, as it seems quite vibrant and capable of displaying a large range of colors.  You really just have to see it in order to fully appreciate it.  Additionally, it has a specific setting that makes reading ebooks an absolute pleasure, greatly reducing stress on my eyes.  I think if I were to put an anti-glare screen protector on it, it might actually be my preferred e-reader.  But if I have to complain about the screen it would be in two areas: the resolution, while being HD, lacks the resolution of other 11 inch tablets.  At 1200x1920, it has a slightly lower pixel density than one might find in the Fire 11.  Additionally, the screen brightness is great for indoor use, but move outside and you may find it's lacking.Another thing I appreciated with both the M9 and the M11 is the sound quality.  This M11 steps up audio quality with 4 Dolby Atmos capable speakers.  The tablet seems to be capable of getting quite loud in comparison to my S20 phone, and range is much better. Lenovo seems consistently able to provide users with respectable audio.And lastly and more importantly, the performance meets my needs. It's quite snappy.  I don't think I'd recommend this for extreme multi tasking, but some of the reviews I found online left me expecting worse.  The smart stylus is very responsive and the device itself opens my apps relatively quickly when compared to the M9.  I don't find myself annoyed with the performance at all.  It's precisely as fast as I need it to be for all my productivity needs.I got this thing on a great sale price and I absolutely do not regret my purchase so far.  I'm looking forward to putting it through the paces.  In a few weeks, I'll be back with an update, but based on my first day's use, I have a feeling I'm not going to have a lot of complaints!2 week update: I have been using this tablet exclusively for engraving non stop for the last two weeks.  The screen has been on, displaying static images of my designs for up to 12 hours at a time with no burn in.  Impressive.  Also, I installed a ""paper feel"" non glare screen protector and it's an absolute game changer.  Reading ebooks with Lenovo's exclusive integrated reading view setting is an amazing experience only bested by true e-ink devices.  Additionally, with a ""paper feel"" screen protector, it truly feels like I'm drawing with a pencil.  Speaking of the active stylus, I discovered it is indeed pressure sensitive.  That quickly became evident when using a sketchbook app with simulated fountain pen.  So if other reviewers are expressing otherwise then it's likely they haven't tested the pressure sensitivity with compatible apps.  It's outstanding.  This has been the best tablet purchase I've ever made!My last word of advice is to buy and apply a screen protector immediately.  I didn't, and wound up with micro scratches on the screen from using the active stylus in a dusty garage relatively quickly.3 week update: Still loving it.  The only other info I'd like to provide is that I've installed a PS1 emulator on it and after connecting my Switch Pro Controller, I'm now even more impressed with the performance and speaker quality.  Playing FF7 on this device, it really makes the audio experience amazing.  Percussion sounds coming from one speaker and the synthesizer coming from another... it's like having a little pseudo surround sound system in a tablet!Final update, I promise:  The battery life on this thing is amazing.  I recently experienced a 6 hour power outage at my home, and used this tablet to watch several movies/shows to pass the time.  After appx 6 hours of video playback, I don't believe the battery indicator dropped below 75%.  That speaks volumes in itself.",5,Tab M11

11/3/2024,"I really like the ease of the setup for the Lenovo tablet, plus it comes with a folio case and tab pen. I needed an android tablet specifically for a class I am taking to download the books to read on the go. The compatibility of an android device with Google Play was needed and the Lenovo tablet did the trick. Battery life is quite good. The charging of the tablet is quick too. Screen size is not too big just perfect with a little weight to it, which to me says it’s sturdy. The price was right and just what I needed. I love the feature on the tablet that you can enable for the reading of downloaded books so you can listen as well and the same can be done with the study materials on the certification prep website given Lenovo’s compatibility. I believe I got my money’s worth. So far so good with my Lenovo tablet and pleasantly pleased.",5,Tab M11

Constantly crashes or locks up when you have more than 1 app in the background. The pen is fine, wish it had buttons.

My computer tech said it was probably the motherboard and there was nothing he could do.  I spent about 3 hours on Lenovo's website trying to find out how to file a warranty claim.  They kept me going in circles.Today, I contacted Amazon for help, and to my surprise, the agent offered a refund, but I opted for a replacement and he agreed.

I do see a tiny bit of lag every once in a while but I find that acceptable given the small form factor convenience. Great for use on a plane so you don't have to turn it off or put it away for takeoff or landing.After using it for an hour or two playing games and hopping on the internet, I have a hard time going back to my phone because it just seems so tiny and hard to see.

It's slow, the screen isn't very responsive, the stylus doesn't feel great, the sound quality is poor and I had to buy an external amplifier to power my wired headphones, it lags constantly and freezes consistently. This isn't a problem that can be fixed, the hardware specifications are simply not enough to keep up with modern apps and streaming requirements. YouTube will crash this device on its own, Amazon shopping will crash this device on its own, and don't even think about using them picture in picture.I'm not upset with the battery life. It last well over a day. Which makes sense because the tablet is so incapable all that battery is doing is powering the screen really. It charges at a decent speed, as long as you have a better charger than the one that comes with it.

12/10/2024,"I was a little apprehensive in buying a phone that wasn't connected directly to my phone carrier.  However as my current phone is coming to the end of it's life (swollen battery split the phone open) and there were some good Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals going on I thought I'd take the chance in trying to buy a phone non-traditionally outside of my phone carrier.On the Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals, Amazon had the best deal on this phone I could find.  My carrier had this phone available as a Black Friday deal for $2/month but required being locked down in a 3 year installment plan/contract.  These days I'm not a fan of being locked down in longterm contracts for phone service.  Plus to get this phone for the discount through my carrier they would have pushed me out of my grandfathered unlimited service plan which gives me the MAX app premium service for free into a new unlimited plan which would take that away.  Amazon was also selling this phone for about $175 cheaper compared to what the list price was on my carrier's website for buying this phone without a contract/installment agreement so again the better deal.As far as the phone is concerned, I find it to be truly amazing.  I'm not the kind of guy to get caught up in the pageantry or the gimmicks of a phone.  I'm a basic text, call and play a game here or there kind of phone user.  Maybe a take a pic or two if something catches my eye so I definitely won't use this phone in ways that many will.  This is also the reason why I went for the FE model over the standard and premium versions of this phone because simply I don't need all the extras that comes with the other models.  Still as the least expensive model in the line up, it packs some robust features and many steps ahead of the phone it replaces (S10e).  I've only been using this phone for a couple weeks now and feel like I'm still on a learning curve about the new functions and features but I can say it's the nicest and best phone I've owned to date.I give it an astonishing 5.0/5.0 rating for a perfect 5 stars!!!",5,Galaxy S24 FE AI
12/9/2024,"I gifted this phone to my wife and now I want one for myself. It's a stylish model with brilliant colors and image quality that stands out every time. She has been using it for a month and we have no complaints. The photos and videos are of very high quality; in fact, we've used it to shoot videos for our channel. I would recommend this product without hesitation.Pros and Cons:Pros: Stylish design, excellent image and video quality, no issues after a month of use, great for multimedia content creation.Contras: None mentioned.",5,Galaxy S24 FE AI
1/21/2025,This is a nice phone and takes great pictures. I switched from one android brand to this one and it took a little getting used to. It is bigger and heavier than my last phone which I didn't like. I do appreciate the long battery life and a bigger screen is nice too. I don't like where the fingerprint scanner is but overall the phone works great.,4,Galaxy S24 FE AI
12/6/2024,"I have a Samsung S23 ultra(see the reflection of it used to take the pictures)that I bought brand new upon release and I've never hated a phone like the S23 Ultra I have. The screen is too big and very unresponsive at the center of the screen while the edges are extremely responsive at slight touch of the palm of my small hand. It's also lagging compared to my S10+ and the powerful camera is uselessly blurry because it takes too long to AI which is supposed to help-focus. I also find the phone battery to drain faster than my S10+ and the Wifi, Bluetooth connection cut off from time to time. The S23 ultra brightness bar is also badly designed compared to the S10+(you can't slowly increase or decrease the brightness on the S23 Ultra like it is on the S10+. A slight slide of the S23 Ultra brightness bar increases or decrease the brightness too much making you waste time trying to find the right middle. The same goes when you want to move the cursor between characters of a text or sms on S23 Ultra. It jumps from c|haracter1 to chara|cter5 when all you wanted was to move the cursor to cha|racter3).It might be that my S23 Ultra has a screen defect and I should've returned it but I didn't. Now I bought this cheaper S24 FE and transferred all my data to it and I swear to God; I'm loving it❤️.The S24 Fe small size is so good in my average man hands and the screen is very responsive with screen protector. The 90° not-round edges are good because my palm doesn't touch the screen while I'm typing. It also has a better camera focus and the brightness bar is not increasing or decreasing a lot with slight slides like it is with the S23 Ultra.The Wifi and Bluetooth connections are also better on the S24 Fe. I still can't believe I spent more than twice the price of this S24 Fe when I bought the S23 Ultra and the S23 Ultra doesn't even have something special that I like and use except the camera that can zoom 10x but is uselessly blurry 2 times out of 3.In summary, everything on the S24 Fe is to my taste ""better"" than the S23 Ultra except the camera zoom which is 10x zoom on the S23 Ultra and 3x zoom on the S24 Fe.Update(12/09/24): While my S24 Fe battery drains slower than my S23 Ultra, its fast charge is a lot slower than the S23 Ultra. I expected the way around because the S23 Ultra has a bigger battery(it might be because I have too many apps on the S23 Ultra which drains battery faster but it doesn't make any sense to me that the S23 Ultra that drains battery faster is also charging faster).I also dislike that Samsung is forcing us to use the new 6-PIN lock on new phones in order to get the option of unlocking your phone by typing your 6 digit PIN without pressing the OK button. On my S23 Utra, when I type my PIN code 1234(example of pin), it unlocks. On S24 Fe, I have to typing 123456 to unlock it. If you use a pin code like 1234 on S24 Fe, you must also press OK to unlock. A small detail but very annoying if you're using your phone as an Uber/Lyft driver where you need to keep your eyes on a busy road while typing a longer PIN code. I had to remove the PIN because I almost had an accident because I'm not used to 6 digits PIN. I'd rather get this cheap phone and data stolen than dying into an accident.",5,Galaxy S24 FE AI
1/11/2025,"I really dragged my feet for years because our old Samsung Galaxy phones were just horrible.  We paid a lot of money for Samsung's flagship phones and they just kept getting worse and worse, so I resisted, but finally our S9s had to go.  True the features like the screen resolution, isn't as good on the FE phone as it was on our old S9, and it's not a Snapdragon processor, but that hasn't been an issue at all.  In fact, we hadn't even noticed.  Upgrading was a piece of cake and along with a nice Samsung case, these phones have been great.My only regret is I'm told the S25s are coming out in a month and had we held off, we would have had a better deal or been able to purchase a newer model.  None-the-less, we're thrilled with these phones.",5,Galaxy S24 FE AI
10/14/2024,"The Samsung FE (fan edition) phones are meant to give customers a flagship phone experience at a more reasonable price, making some strategic compromises to make that happen.  I think they succeeded for the most part with the S24 FE.The display and camera are the two key factors in phone quality, in my opinion.  The display here is an FHD+ (basically 1080p) 6.7"" AMOLED, which is the same size as the S24+ with a lower resolution.  The AMOLED gives great response timea and black levels and the lower resolution is not very important to overall image quality.  I am impressed for the price.Photo quality is excellent and similar to the S24+, with particularly impressive 4K60 video quality.  It can also record 8K30 if you want to have some room for cropping.  I normally go with Google phones, and it is a close competition.  I think the Pixels do a better job in low light and have more vivid colors with default settings.  The AI tools are fun to play with, but feel very early.  I don't see a generative function that allows you to type in things to fill selected areas with, but I may be missing it.The chipset is notably slower than the S24+, which is not very relevant in my usage so far.  This is still a capable 2024 exynos and able to handle demanding apps and multitasking.  It may not last as many years without becoming outdated.This is my first Samsung and I was happy to see it was not stuffed with intrusive Samsung apps I may not prefer over other apps.  The Samsung AI for things like translation is cool and the phone also comes with Google AI for things like circle to search.  With that, you can point your camera at anything in the phone app, hold the home button down, then circle something to search for it.  It works remarkably well and better than any AI tool I have used before.  Everyone I've shown it to was blown away.Without a case, the phone feels like an oiled up brick that tries to slip from my hands.  With a case, that is solved and, while a little clunky, is not bad to hold for long periods.Overall, this is an excellent phone that achieves the goal of giving a flagship experience.",4,Galaxy S24 FE AI
1/13/2025,"This phone has some questionable attributes, imho.The screen (under a quality glass protector) is not as reactive as I am used to on previous Galaxy phones.  And the positioning of the icons is either off center or too small to find accurately.Reception is good.  Sound quality is good.  Camera is good. This phone does all that I want and need, for the most part.  My only criticism is in the sensitivity of the touch screen.  Worthy of note.Would I buy this again?  mmmmm  I would likely spend the extra money and buy the Galaxy S24 Plus.",4,Galaxy S24 FE AI
12/9/2024,"This works mostly well. Not as much bloatware as Samsung used to have. Most of the AI stuff is gimmicky and locked behind a Samsung account. And may soon need a subscription to use. There are many “features” that are just redundant. You can have apps on the main screen, have apps in the app drawer and then there is the side panel that you can hide apps but accessing the side panel takes a swipe to the left which also means you can just place the apps on another Home Screen that would take the same amount of time to access, so why? I guess options are good. The bad part is browsing webpages using the installed browsers. Some embedded content on some sites just would not load. Which is strange. The camera is ok. Maybe at half the original price this phone is good but definitely not worth the full asking price.",4,Galaxy S24 FE AI
12/9/2024,"My last 4-5 phones have been in the Samsung Galaxy universe. The previous phone was my first FE (S20). I went the FE route again and am very happy with the product compared to the price (bought on Cyber Monday). I feel like I have a high-end phone without the higher price tag of the Ultra. I went ahead and turned on all the bells and whistles (AI, Google Assistant) and am having fun learning more about how to use those.  I haven't tried the real time translation feature, but I will at some point. The transfer from my old to new phone was seamless. I did a tech support chat with my provider (Verizon) though to swtitch to an eSIM since the SIM in my old phone was a different size than what is supported on the 24 FE. That text chat went quickly, and my phone was up and running with all my previous apps and data.",5,Galaxy S24 FE AI
1/8/2025,"I purchased this phone as a Christmas gift for my son. At first I was going to just go with the S24 instead of the S24FE but I figured I would save a little money and hope with one would hold up. So far it seems to work very well, plenty of processing power. I purchased a good case and screen protector so hopefully it will last a few years with no damage.",5,Galaxy S24 FE AI
12/3/2024,"I am in love with this phone!! I haven't explored everything yet, but so far, I am totally in love with this phone! I use straight talk for service and this phone is indeed compatible with straight talk. There was a review on Amazon and unfortunately that individual was not able to use the phone but I had no issues with the phone. If you are switching from another phone, simply put your existing Sim card into the new phone and it should work. If not, purchase the sim card kit from straight talk. The picture quality is great! Holds a good charge as well. I wish I had more to add but I am not done exploring. I will add more as I explore.",4,Galaxy S24 FE AI
11/29/2024,"I rec'd this new, unlocked Samsung Galaxy S24 FE on Nov. 23,2024 from Amazon & it measures up to my expectations (granted, I don't use all of its functionality).  Heads-up: Spectrum's website said both IMEIs were non-compatible, as did their on-line Chat C/S person even tho Spectrum sells the same phone/model (at a higher price)!!  However, I transferred the Spectrum chip from my old Moto G to the S24 FE;  it worked & continues to work just fine.  Note: The Spectrum C/S person did submit request for 'Phone Number Transfer' & hours later, I rec'd a Spectrum email stating  ""Your request for a new SIM card has been completed and transferred to the phone number xxx-xxx-xxxx"".

12/20/2024,"I got this s24 during the Black friday sale, and I have been loving it so far. Great sound, clear display, and no lag. The battery last for hours for non-stop gaming.

10/5/2024,"I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",4,Galaxy S24 FE AI

12/28/2024,"My past 3 phones were Motorola, each was a couple hundred dollars. This time I thought to try something new and more expensive.  Now consider that I am not a power user, 99% of incoming calls are spam.  That said, I don't see much of a difference to justify the price. Yeah, the Samsung is a bit more refined and some nice features (better camera of course) but there are a couple things that I really don't like. First, I have to tap the screen twice to wake it up even though I have the setting to wake if I handle the phone. The Motorola wakes just fine with the slightest touch. Second, the finger print sensor is at times hard to see, so sometimes it takes too long to get into my apps. The Motorola has a dedicated finger print hole that worked much better. I'll probably go back to Motorola when this phone gets old.",3,Galaxy S24 FE AI

There are so many customizable options, including camera quality, and I love the AI enhancements it has. Thanks Samsung!",5,Galaxy S24+
10/12/2024,"When a phone costs $1000 it better be special.  I have had Samsung galaxies or my last 2 phones, and I'm sold.  However a grand for a phone is too steep.  So, I waited for a sale and purchased unlocked for $750.Still pricey, but it is worth it.  It has a fast processor.  The battery lasts 16 hours or more, at the end of the day I typically have 40% charge remaining.Iwas worried about having enough storage, without an external micro disc slot, but I've added more apps than I have ever had, and I download a number of streaming shows for offline viewing and still have plenty of space left.  12 gb RAM is also nice, I usually have 6 to 7 gb free at any given time.Overall my fastest and most favorite phone yet.",5,Galaxy S24+
12/14/2024,"I went from the S10 to the S24+, and I love it! The battery so far works way better, and all the extra features are nice. I also have the Samsung watch, and the apps are great, especially the health app. I also have Straight Talk and was worried about setup a bit. All you need is an eSIM or SIM card (costing about $5), and you're good to go. I've had the phone for a little over a month. Great phone, great camera.",5,Galaxy S24+
8/27/2024,"I love everything about this phone! I got for a great price during Amazon's summer sale. It's a solid and well made device. I also bit the bullet and switched to a new mobile service provider at the same time when I activated the phone (it was easy and I was able to keep the same cellphone number). I had no problem doing this because the phone is ""unlocked"". As soon as I finished setting up the phone I saw that all my contacts, apps, photos, files, etc. transferred without a single hitch from my old Samsung Galaxy S8+.  The display is nice and big and the resolution and colors are very sharp and brilliant. The sound quality is truly awesome as well. I noticed right away that it was much better than my last phone when I listened to some music (I'm a professional trumpet player and I prefer listening to music genres that include Jazz, Classical, Folk and British Brass Bands). I would definitely recommend this product.",5,Galaxy S24+
11/27/2024,"I got this phone after my galaxy s7 (yes I know, I dinosaur) starting taking it upon itself and deleting apps that wouldn't update anymore. I needed a lot of storage so I got the one with the most. I am confused by many features, in part because there is no instruction manual, just a quick start guide. I've had to google many things and then realized the guide is also on the phone. But all of this really on me. The camera is awesome though and the pictures on portrait mode look professional.",4,Galaxy S24+
11/29/2024,"Coming from an s10+ I know it will be a great phone, but feels like more of the same. Probably because the phone industry reached a plateau now.The phone is great and faster, but that's about it.Also, I wish manufacturers weren't cheap and included the headphones and charging brick. Also, the lack of a minijack is annoying.",5,Galaxy S24+
12/4/2024,"Light wt, sturdy, and pretty. For some reason after about 1 mth calls started to came thru when  muted. I did all the trouble shooting I was instructed to do but calls still come thru on mute..",5,Galaxy S24+
1/23/2025,"My return window expired on 11/19 and this is Jan 23 so I am stuck.  I have had multiple Samsung phones and have always been very happy with them.  This one is much worse than my previous S9+ which was 6 years old.  The major issue is the fingerprint scanner.  I have both fingerprint (two separate fingers) and face recognition activated and I still have to try multiple times 90% of the time.  Even with multiple attempts, nothing works 60% of the time and I must put in my pin.  It is so bad that I am close to moving to Apple and I hate learning new systems without a functional reason.  I would go back to my old phone except the battery life had become very short and the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone was seriously scratched, but it still worked much better than my S24+.  My other issues with the phone are minor and would rate a 4 star review.  Those minor issues are the size which is a little bigger than is comfortable, the fingerprint scanner being on the front screen rather than the back of the phone which requires two hands to unlock and an iniblility to activate the Google messaging which Samsung now recommends.  Lastly, Samsung’s keyboard now has the microphone icon on the far, bottom right corner of the screen which often causes a new app to open rather than the voice recognition screen.  This later issue seems to be getting better for the apps I use frequently, but not other apps.  I am guessing that the apps remember what my normal usage requires.  Still, it is a poorly designed keyboard layout and Samsung doesn’t permit using any other.  I am going to call Samsung support to see if they can ameliorate any of these issues before I look for another phone.  They have been excellent in resolving issues on my prior phones but were unable to help me with activating the recommended Google messaging on this one.  If am able to resolve any of the significant issues I will modify this review accordingly.",1,Galaxy S24+
1/1/2025,"I recently upgraded from the Samsung S20 FE to the Samsung S24+. It's a similar size to the S20 FE, so it doesn't feel uncomfortable in my hand. The camera is way better, and the battery life is longer. The UI layout and customization are better, and the AI features are cool. If you have a recent model phone, the S24+ may not be worth the upgrade. But if your phone is three generations old or more, I definitely recommend it.",5,Galaxy S24+
10/14/2024,"Have been using an iPhone 14 Pro Max for the last few months. Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for 4 years, and before that was on iPhone since the iPhone 4. I don't play the android vs ios games, so if you're looking for that pointless narrative then go elsewhere. I'm writing this review to share my experience having throughly used both platforms.Apple has masterfully crafted a user experience that works just fine for most users. These people don't care about customizing or having an ""always on display"" that's actually always on. You have to be brainwashed not to admit that the iPhones AOD isn't really always on, no matter what settings you use. What iPhones has going for it is a finely tuned phone, texting, facetime, apple pay experience - things that make owning an iPhone convenient.What makes Android worth owning is the ability to use it how you wanted to use it instead of a corporation telling you you're ""holding it wrong."" I enjoyed the galaxy s10. It had an excellent display, almost indistinguishable from the s24. My review will focus on the user experience/software of the S24, not the hardware. Hardware has gotten so powerful that most users will never need all that processing power.Samsung has failed to finely tune their software like Apple has. I liked s10's OneUI look - S24 is ugly in comparison. The stark blue and light grey quick menu has been replaced with an ugly ""Material You"" color pallet. You can download ""GoodLock"" and try to change the color palette, but countless things like transparency don't work with it. Bottom line is why I  would need to spend time trying to make it look decent if it's Samsung job considering the inflated price of these phones. So many things that should be included with the phone have been placed behind a paywall, forcing you to pay to get back what was part of OneUI in older versions.Another indication that Samsung isn't tuning its software is the fact that they gave up on their ""message"" app, now forcing you to use Googles message service, which is fine, but why bother having their own app if they never really committed to it?So many other system apps, Samsung has to confuse the user into deciding which platform to use. You will have double the apps for every single system app, again confusing the user into deciding in which service to commit to.I like Android, but I don't like Samsung. I don't see the point in spending a super premium price for a phone that's not fully committed to either own layer like ONEUI or Android. This has been the problem with Samsung phones since they released ONEUI. Either fully commit to your own version, or commit to stock Android - stop confusing consumers about what your product is about, and stop being scammy by holding back features behind a paywall.My recommendation for Android users is this: You don't need to pay a super premium price to get the Android experience. Today's budget phones are powerful enough to allow you to customize it according to your own liking.",3,Galaxy S24+

10/11/2024,"I bought this phone because I had an S21 for 3 years and loved it.  I felt sure this phone would be just as good.  I like it, but I don't love it.  The phone doesn't take pictures as well as the S21, no matter what I do they are still slightly blurry, not clear.  The audio is no where near as good as my S21.  I guess there aren't as many speakers in the phone, but the sound is almost muted sounding even if the volume is as high as it will go.  My ear buds sound great,  though.  Other than that, it works pretty much the same as the S21.",4,Galaxy S24+

9/14/2024,"I've been using cell phones ever since they were a brick, and like most I've gone through many. I'm kind of old so I've watched them grow. I've owned a number of brands but for now I stick with Samsung. This phone is like watching Startrack when it that first came out (OMG). The features and capabilities are mind blowing. If you're looking for something to replace your wristwatch, pocket camera, Mp3 player, movie viewer, your E-Book reader, your Audio Book player, Your laptop, and much, much more. Look no further. Oh yes don't forget it also makes phone calls.Someone somewhere said it would not work with Tracfone but yes it does. Mine is hooked up and for me that is all the service I need.There is a ton of articles written on this phone by people smarted then I so I'll not go into all of that but as for me I love it!Remember as is all things in life you only get out what you're willing to put in. In this case download the manual and give it a read.",5,Galaxy S24+

3/3/2024,"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data.",3,Galaxy S24+

I first put my old Verizon SIM card into the physical Sim slot and it worked okay, but then I later had them activate the e-sim slot and I'm using that now. My only caution is that you be sure to back up your phone to either Google or Samsung so that when you make the smart transfer to your new phone everything moves over.",5,Galaxy S24+
7/30/2024,"This is a fantastic phone for the most part. Fast, animations are smooth, feels premium, long battery life. Samsung software is pretty good.HOWEVER, this and other S24 models have serious issues with OLED ""grain"". This appears as uneven grey colors at low brightness. It's super distracting if you use dark mode. It's one of those things that, once you notice it, you will see it forever. My first unit had terrible grain, so I returned it and got another one. The second one is perfectly fine, and I love it. Just be aware of it if you are sensitive to display issues.",4,Galaxy S24+

8/31/2024,"Easy to insert phone into the case and apply lens and screen protector.  I got the sparkles which are nice and low key. Doesn't look cheap or preteen like some I've seen. I wanted something that didn't cover the nice color and finish of my phone. I dropped my phone outside, face down and not a scratch, chip or crack. The cover for the screen hasn't affected unlocking my phone using fingerprint or charging it on a wireless charger.I like that the sides are sturdy and fit snug but are still flexible enough not to make it a challenge to get the phone in.",5,Galaxy S24+
8/1/2024,"The product looked good when delivered and I didn't notice the touchscreen problems until the next day after I downloaded everything to the phone. I have no screen protector that could be interfering with it. I am considering deleting everything and returning it but that is a lot of hassle. I had a very slow phone, which I used for years before this, so it's still an improvement. For $800  I would expect a phone that works as good as new. The other thing is the talk to text. Definitely.Adds periods and punctuation where it does not belong I end up having to correct a lot of what is said I left the last few sentences uncorrected, so you could see. Battery life, was good the first week And it might be the apps that I added that are sucking up the battery. I would say it's definitely the apps that are  running in the background. So I would say, overall, a good phone, but I wish the companies would test functionality a little more thoroughly, because the touchscreen is the most irritating thing to have to push on something six times to get it to respond. I am curious if this was a problem with the S24+ originally",3,Galaxy S24+
8/31/2024,"I got this phone cuz I needed an upgrade. The battery on my S10 wasn't lasting very long. Honestly, I'm not impressed. It has awesome battery life and for the most part everything seems to work the way it should. However it has the worst fingerprint recognition scanner of any phone I've used. I'm having to enter the code about half of the time, and yes I've deleted the fingerprint imprint and redone it several times to the same effect.Also, even though I downloaded the UI update and installed it, it constantly says there's an update, tries to download it, halfway through it clears out the Wi-Fi password and pauses the install.  The smart transfer feature did not transfer password and logins to all of my various apps, even though another phone I got at the same time... A free phone from straight talk, copied everything perfectly.I'm sure these are all issues I will eventually overcome... But when I pay several hundred dollars for a phone, I expect it to be easier and work better.I also don't understand why they don't include an option to add an SD card.",3,Galaxy S24+

11/24/2024,"I grudgingly gave up my Samsung Note 8, which I dearly loved and bought the S24 Plus, only because I was more and more concerned about security and updates, which the Note 8 doesn't get anymore. Many new apps wouldn't work on it either, the OS was Android 9 and it was just too outdated I guess.  The S24+ is a little shorter and wider and I thought it would be okay, but today I had my first lengthy phone conversation and it became pretty uncomfortable in my hand.  The flat sides, (like the iPhone now) just aren't comfortable to grip in your hand for any length of time.  I""m not talking about the corners which aren't as squared off as the Ultra,  I'm talking about the FLAT SIDES of the phone.  Why oh Why Samsung, are you trying to become an iPhone?  I've never had a phone as comfortable to hold as the Note. The curved (Infinity) screen was super soft to use, no side bezels at all, and the glass back with rounded sides was perfectly fitted to a human hand. I realize gamers didn't like it, but it was so comfortable for everyday use.  Maybe I'll try to find a case that will soften the sides of the S24 Plus phone by rounding them a little and that might make it better.  But, this isn't a great phone for me.",2,Galaxy S24+

12/4/2024,"After having this phone for 9months, I am so disappointed that I want to let readers know that this phone is not worth it.  After 4 months of usage I notice that the keyboard sometime does not sense what I am typing, so it will miss a letter or two.  Sometime I have to press the apps more than once for it to react too. Now as I am traveling using esim in another country, I notice the phone does not receive full as to my previous S10+. Therefore, I am glad I have my old S10+ as a backup to switch the sim card, and now the signals is strong again.  One more thing, when I am all by myself and nothing around me is moving, I can hear the mechanics inside the phone making noises.  Overall, I have a feeling that this phone won't last me another year, which is why is not worth your money...",2,Galaxy S24+

I rely on their input for my impressions and then I ogle the colors and how it fits in my hand and how fast it goes and can I type better on the shrunken keyboard -- all while trusting the professional reviewers.  I'm writing this review for people like me.  Do your own research and trust in that.  I think I got a terrific phone that looks phenomenal and will last me for at least 7 more years.  And using it is so easy.  Transferring everything was so easy.  Now I'll have to master the camera.  Nitpicky opinions are no longer useful.  ""It should have square corners, it should have round corners, they did this, why didn't they do that..."" ENOUGH.

6/26/2024,"I have been a fan and purchase of many Samsung products over the years.  Their small electronic devices is their real strength.  This phone is no exception to that assessment.  It's got all of the features that I'm familiar with and some additional ones to enhance the user experience.  The screen is vibrant and easy to look at for an extended period.  If you are an avid Android user, and you want/need a new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S24+ is an excellent choice.",5,Galaxy S24+
2/1/2024,"Prior to buying the s24+ I purchased a Pixel 8 Pro and really wanted to love it. That however turned into pure frustration with multiple glitches in the first two weeks of ownership that Google support couldn't fix. So much so, that the Pixel 8 Pro was returned in favor of the s24+. I am so glad I did that, because owning the s24+ has been nothing but pure joy. I mean this phone rocks in every way and the transition from my old s10 5g was seamless and straightforward. It literally took couple of hours from start to finish and there is no learning curve. With the Pixel 8 Pro transferring data was a complete disaster with multiple glitches, unfixable bugs and a few calls to Google support. There were some many issues with the Pixel 8 Pro that it would take an essay to list them all. Thank you Samsung for turning my frustration into pure joy!",5,Galaxy S24+

8/23/2024,"I thought I'd treat myself for my birthday and get myself a nice new phone. I got the S24+ and at first I was happy with it. However, 3 to 4 weeks later I noticed a couple of small dots in the lower corner of the display where the display seemed washed out. I immediately went through the process of sending it in to get it repaired thinking that it would certainly be covered as it was clearly a manufacturing defect. A few days later I get a message telling me I'd need to pay $300 to get it fixed. I called in and they tell me it's an impact related issue. In other words that I must have dropped my phone and therefore it must be my fault. I hadn't even had the phone for a month yet and can say with absolute certainty that I never dropped it or did anything else to it that would cause the issue. I tried to explain that to their customer service. I tried to point out that the screen isn't cracked. That it looks like it's a de-lamination issue. I explained that I'm an engineer and that I work at an electronics manufacturing plant and that I know what I'm talking about. The person I was talking to just kept telling me that I was wrong because the report he was reading said it was impact related. And of course in the time it took for all of this to play out, it's now 3 days over the 1 month refund so I basically just got scammed out of $1000. Personally I would go with a different company that has better customer support. This is just insulting.**Added photos. You can see the three spots circled. They aren't chips or cracks and the pixels still light up. You can also see that, while the glass goes out to the edge of the screen, the spots stop right at the edge of the display.Clearly that is the display peeling off of the glass and no kind of 'impact related damage' is going to cause that while leaving the rest of the phone completely unharmed.Yes they are small and if they stay like that I won't be thrilled but I can live with it. But I hadn't even had the phone for a month when they showed up so I am expecting the issue to get worse.",1,Galaxy S24+
2/2/2024,"Phone is great so far.  My issue is with Amazon customer service.  I never received the $150 e-gift card.  I contacted customer service and they act like they have no idea what I am talking about even though I sent them a screenshot of the order showing it was redeemed.UPDATE:  As someone else mentioned, you have to purchase something that is shipped and sold from Amazon.  Pretty limiting.  I wanted to purchase a new charger -  Samsung, Anker, Ugreen all ship from their own stores.  Also, it shows as a discount rather than a Gift Card.",4,Galaxy S24+
8/15/2024,I place battery life near the top of my list and this s24+ is great on battery life.  It is also boots much faster than my last phone (S20FE).  Also enjoying the 5GUC coverage I now get with T-Mobile.  So far I like everything about this phone.,5,Galaxy S24+
6/10/2024,"With apps no longer being supported on my phone (Samsung S8), I needed to buy a replacement.  Since I didn't want a stylist, I ruled out the Samsung Ultra.  The Samsung S24 was smaller than my previous phone so the S24 was out.  I found the S24+ to be the sweet spot in terms of battery life, storage and memory so this was a quick decision.  So far the phone has been a great replacement and I have no negatives so far.",5,Galaxy S24+

Having all storage embedded in the phone may increase performance; however, it also eliminates local storage upgrade options. Only real option is to use cloud storage if local storage grows too quickly.Really love the quality improvements for the camera!! Improved screen and slight screen increase from base to + models is a nice touch. I remain impressed with the screen.After months I am very happy with the s24+.",5,Galaxy S24+

12/6/2024,"Aside from simply browsing the internet and checking email etc, which every tablet should be able to do, there are two main reasons to get this tablet IMHO.It excels at drawing.  It's been a while since I've looked into drawing tablets - back in the day if you wanted a good tablet for drawing you got a mid screen and all it did was draw.  No internet, nothing.  This is a full fat tablet (that basically does the role of a desktop or laptop for your average user) and it has a great pen experience.  I've been drawing with krita, which is a very feature dense program and there is no lag.The other thing it does great is media.  The screen is awesome and the speakers are surprisingly loud.  Because it's in the android ecosystem you can run Firefox as your browser and get ublock origin meaning you never have to see ads as long as you're using Firefox (notably for YouTube). The tablet also natively will keep playing YouTube when you turn off the screen.  Or at least it does with Firefox - never had any desire to download the app, frankly.  The screen is big enough to be a significant improvement over even a large phone. But not so big that it feels hard to be portable.The other half of media is games.  Obviously this is not a gaming PC.  It's not going to run any real heavy duty games.  But if you want it for mobile games especially card games like slay the spire, legends of runeterra, or hearthstone, then this is just basically the perfect device for them.  The screen has great color and contrast, so since graphical fidelity is not the limiter with these, they can actually look better on this than a PC because the screen is great.  It's also basically the perfect size for card games.  Large enough to feel like the full primo experience, but small enough you don't feel like you are dragging your finger across miles of realestate for every action.Seems the one place that isn't amazing is the battery.  The battery is fine.  It's not bad, it's not great.  It will last you long enough, but it's not going to knock your socks off.Unless you have a really specific reason that you absolutely NEED a larger screen or something, I can't really imagine recommending a different tablet at the moment.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
8/25/2024,"Bought this on discount.  Definitely worth the price at the point.  With the S-Pen and the good usability of the tablet, I find it very useful for browsing and doing minor edits in Google Docs, etc.  The battery life is pretty decent, and the screen and sound is pretty good for watching videos.  Better than the Kindle 10 fire.So if you only want to watch videos / browse and not do much else, buying a Kindle 10 Fire on discount is probably a better deal.  Though if you want to do more productivity stuff, the S-Pen that comes with it is very handy.  There are plenty of affordable and sturdy cases for this device that will also hold the pen.In terms of speed, it works fine.  But if you've used an iPad Pro, you will notice it has more of a lag when loading new web pages.  Not enough to matter, but to be noted if you're used to the rapid loading speeds. Upon initial device setup, there's a lot of software updates, etc. which makes the lag more noticeable until they're all done.Finally, you can also consider the Samsung FE tablet, which is more premium table for more money.  I ended up sticking with this one, not because of the price, but because that one is about 20% heavier, and this lightweight tablet made it so easy to carry and use.  Also, there are sometimes trade programs to get the FE tablet.  If you use this one for a few years, then pay a little bit to get more for a new FE tablet, then it's an even better deal.  But you can't go wrong with the FE tablet now too if you're in the market for a more powerful device.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
1/20/2025,"I have been using the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) for several months. It was easy to transfer information from my Samsung phone to the tablet - even for someone in her 70s. In a short amount of time, I transferred all my favorite apps and pictures. I have a laptop but the tablet is lighter in weight and easier to use on the go or when watching TV. The memory is adequate for my needs and I especially like the stylus. The tablet charges in a short amount of time and I have no complaints about the length of the charge. The speed and clarity are great.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
5/20/2024,"I have this as a secondary tablet, alongside an M1 iPad Pro 11"".The Tab S6 Lite is no where near as powerful, but that's ok. It's still a quite usable tablet, with solid construction and good battery life.My main use cases: taking notes with Samsung Notes, reading books (FBReader, Bible Study by Olive Tree), playing games (nothing demanding, mostly Stardew Valley, Another Eden, and some emulation of older consoles), programming (under Termux), music (YT Music) and audio books (Audible). All of these work well on it. It takes a little longer to start some of the games than my iPad, but they run fine once loaded. It's not great for multitasking. I've found that using two apps in split screen is ok. It feels a bit sluggish with three on screen. When running larger games it'll have to restart apps when switching. None of this is problematic for me, but it's worth noting.Battery life has been good so far. On my longest day with it I started using it about 10 AM, and plugged it in at 11 PM with 29% remaining battery. During that time I only had the screen off for two hours, and it was otherwise in continual use. (I run about 25-30% brightness). About half of that time was spent reading, and the rest was a mix of playing Stardew Valley, taking notes, and programming under Termux.Notetaking is pretty nice. The included S Pen works well, and attaches magnetically to the top. It does not need charging, so is always ready to use. My son (more artistically inclined than I) says it's not as good at pressure sensitivity as the Apple Pencil, but he had no complaints with the feel or accuracy.The build quality is fine. The tablet is a little heavy, but feels solid. It's a touch more slippery than I'd like, but this hasn't actually been a problem. I have no other complaints on this.The display is a bit of a let down. The resolution is fine, but there's a bit of backlight bleed along the edge with the USB C port. It also has a lot of glare. I can mostly ignore these, but they are sometimes a bit problematic.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

8/28/2024,"I have found this tablet to be a nice size, weight, and easy to set up to use.  I transferred information from my cell phone without a hitch, other than for the few programs that required that some data be entered again for privacy and protection purposes.  Every tablet I have ever had has used battery power much more quickly than cell phones, and this one is typical in that respect.  They are also slower to recharge, as a rule, and this one is typical in that regard.  However, I did buy a charger for this tablet that had a higher speed and charge strength than what I use on my cell phone.  I found that the tablet charged very quickly with this charger, so some of the people who had charging issues might want to do the same.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
8/23/2024,"I'm a Junior in engineering at college this year so I got tired of carrying my notebooks so bad, this has become my best friend.I've been trying my tablet for over a month now and it is now one of my essential tools everyday.For note making I stick to the Samsung Notes app and I have no issues at all for work, it helps me get everything organized and pretty with the customization of the pages and grids available. I've been doing a couple of classes over the summer and it has been great writing down everything digitally, since I pass those notes frequently onto my computer I had no issues at all.And as for drawing there aren't any great apps such as procreate but I was able to work with the app called sketchbook, it has really simple features and options but being free and all is actually a life saver.Of course, as another recommendation try and buy the protector screen and the case, using the pen so much might scratch so it's best to pay a little more for that protection.Also buying an SD card is a game changer, I expect myself to do tons of notes and already have many games installed so that was only for me, but it's not like any other apple device that storage runs out really fast, I've tried ipads before but im more fond of android systems, plus the battery lasts so much.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
10/30/2024,"Hello everyone 😁, who’s considering this tablet.This is a pretty mediocre tablet, but it does a decent job. The problems I have with it, is that it’s not very future proof, let alone a current day proof. The 60hz refresh should have a variable option for at least 90hz in my opinion, especially for gaming. Nice looking decent sized display, it’s what Samsung does best. Great battery life, would last days without barely dipping the battery percentages. But storage and ram? 4gbs of ram and 64gb worth of storage is very underwhelming especially for a 2024 device. You can get the more storage model or buy your own micro ssd for more storage which is a plus. But wouldn’t have the as quick read and write speed as the internal. But 4 gbs is starting to be really cutting it for most daily operations. Especially if you have multiple apps opened. The S pen is great but durability lacks a bit. My pen nib wore out after only 2 months of usage. If you are an artist and wanted to get this tablet I recommend getting a paper screen cover and a metal nib. It’ll feel way better.Being the lite version. This tablet loses some features from the other models. One being the full dex experience and which was a main reason I got an Samsung tablet. Shouldve done more research. Found out that it doesn’t support hdmi output. Which is a big letdown. You can use a wireless version but the input lags makes it a bit unbearable. Even my old Samsung Galaxy S9+ phone supports hdmi output and does an amazing job at it. It’s unfortunate they cheap out on that.It’s a decent tablet for kids or teens, but there’s a lot better options especially for the price.If you can do your research or market hunting, finding a used S8 or even an S7 would be a way better experince. If you want a bigger display, an A9+ 128gb model has 8gbs around the same price. I find that to be more future proofing but it doesn’t have the pen. If you want to go new the S9FE especially if it’s on sale for like $300 it’s more worth it in my opinion. Even an older iPad would be more worth it.Thanks for reading! Good luck on tablet shopping, I hope y'all find the tablet that fits your needs. It could be this tablet. It just didn’t for me. 😔 well have a good day yall!",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
11/10/2024,"It lags sometimes, especially during startup.  4 gb RAM is Not Enough!  This needs 6 gb RAM in order to operate more smoothly.  Also, the motion smoothness is not good, i think it's 60 Hz- i almost returned it because the scrolling is blurry, but I just scroll slower.  Wish it would give you a smoother refresh rate, like 120 Hz.Also I got a bookcover/stand that also works to 'wake' your tablet.  I finally was able to find a way to turn that off, as it was affecting the touchscreen a lot.  I still find that when I'm watching a video, the magnet part of the bookcover still occasionally interferes, freezing the touchscreen of my tablet, but if i move the bottom (magnetic part of the cover), I'm able to start using the touchscreen again.  They need to fix this, as I never had this problem with my Galaxy Tab S2 and it also has the magnet cover.The Smaller size of this tablet is perfect- that'swhy I gave it 4 instead of 3 stars.  Sadly, it's the Only newer Samsung tablet with a smaller, portable size.  The other newer Samsung Tablets are TOO BIG AND TOO RECTANGULAR!!  If I'm watching a video in bed (or anywhere) i dont need a Big screen in front of me- it strains the eyes!It would be nice if they made a tablet in this small size with better options, like higher RAM, better motion smoothness, on screen fingerprint reader, etc.  It would also be nice if they stopped making them so rectangular but rather more square, like the Ipads.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

So I had to order yet another gadget - an adapter, just to get it charged so I could set it up. Very annoying. But it seems to have copied over all my apps and almost everything set up ok. One app still isn't working on it. But I'll keep trying. It did take all day to get it set up. I do recommend this one, but you will need an adapter to charge it.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

I primarily use the tablets to store music and videos for my fiddle and mandolin playing and Irish stepdancing. Since considerations for gaming and video are not part of my usage, these tablets work fine. The fact that I can store stuff on a micro SD card means I can move my data from tablet to tablet with very little interruption in my use. My only complaint is that the 10"" size, while nice for videos (especially for dance steps), is less comfortable for my small hands.

8/24/2024,"This is the third Samsung tablet that I have purchased over the last 12 years. I am a loyal and happy Samsung customer. First tablet lasted for years! Second one not as long but that's on me. I should have purchased one with more memory since my gaming habits increased but it was still a great product. So I decided to purchase a new tablet with more memory and more capability to manage my increased usage beyond games.I received my tablet promptly and was extremely happy with my purchase. Went to bed one night with the tablet working and when I got up in the morning it was dead. Not completely dead but just a flickering screen and no way to turn off or reboot. I guess I got a lemon. Sometimes this happens and a product is just defective. So I began the return process. I would still buy this tablet again but Amazon did not give me an option to replace.Instead of getting a shipping label, I got an insert for the package and instructions telling me that the UPS man would pick up the package and bring me the label and that I needed to be home for the next several days for when he showed up. I was dubious but gave it a fair shot. Monday three I called the UPS number provided to me and was told that there was not a pick up scheduled and that I should contact Amazon. I live in a relatively rural area and honestly UPS doesn't do scheduled pick ups. We have a local business that also is a UPS drop off center that has dedicated staff for UPS service. So I brought my package and instructions to the drop off and the staff tried to figure out a return option on my Amazon account but ended up giving me the Amazon number and instructed me to explain to them that I need an actual mailing label and that we don't have scheduled pick- ups locally except for the drop off center. I called Amazon and explained my situation. The first representative I talked was courteous and tried to be helpful but admitted she could not figure it out so she was transferring me to a ""specialist"".Wow. This so-called specialist was terrible. I told her I am literally at a staffed UPS center as we speak and we could get this resolved now but that the scheduled pickup really wasn't a viable option. She completely ignored anything I said and just continued to process this the way she wanted and then told me that it would get picked up in the next 7 days and of course I need to be present for the pickup. She tried to justify this by saying that because of the value of the product, it needed to be handed to the courier. Okay, but I am at the UPS center with an actual human being who can address this issue so it really is not an issue at all.Now I have to call UPS on Monday and make sure there is a pickup scheduled (doubtful) and then call and bug Amazon to get it right and continue this for how long? No. I am going to drive to the actual UPS hub that's 20 miles away on Tuesday if this is not completely in place on Monday. From Friday morning to Monday is long enough to schedule a pickup.I am honestly aggravated by the whole experience. Last word, buy Samsung but think about if you should buy it on Amazon because if you have to return it then it will be a NIGHTMARE. Apparently it makes sense to Amazon that a person will be home and available for an entire week for a package to get picked up. 2 stars because it's a good product and glitches happen but Amazon gets a negative rating on customer service in this case.Update: finally got this picked up and the UPS man asked ""why couldn't you bring this to the UPS at Toner Planet"" lol. He said they can print the label just as easily. Well, just relieved it got picked up. Hopefully the return is now hassle free.",2,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
9/13/2024,"The screen was surprisingly dim, even after adjusting the Display Settings.  The tablet was supposed to be new, but the seal on its box was broken on arrival.  Everything inside looked okay, but I wondered if the LCD screen on all S6 Lite tablets are as light and dim as mine was.  I'm used to an AMOLED screen on my Galaxy phone, so when this tablet's screen was so dim, I ordered a Galaxy S8+ Plus tablet with AMOLED screen, and its screen was fabulous!  Bright, rich colors and crisp, vivid images.  Totally different than this S6 Lite.  Researched this tablet before ordering.  Also read reviews, and others have praised this tablet's screen.  So maybe since mine had been opened, it just wasn't working quite right.  Everything else, like the battery life, was great!  And the pink gold color of the back of the tablet was gorgeous.  The screen image was my only complaint, but it was just so super dim and washed out looking, I just wasn't happy with it, so returned the tablet.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

8/10/2024,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite runs into some performance issues, especially when attempting to multitask. 4 gbs of RAM is just too low. For multimedia purposes, the device performs decent enough. It has a good display, and enough performance to run lower end 2d games. The design still feels reasonably modern-esque.In a lot of things in raw specs, this thing isn't that well positioned in the market. the 128 GB version of the A9+, when on sale, goes for 11 bucks or so more and 8 gbs of RAM and a 90hz display instead of 60. And that's just a direct Samsung example. However, the main thing this device has going for it is coming with a remarkably solid stylus, and performing well enough at things involving that stylus. Lenovo is notorious for software issues. There is no other device on the market with that combination of excellent stylus support, software support, and being outright dirt cheap relative to other more noteworthy stylus and tablet combos.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

7/17/2024,"The initial setup took a little while but that is to be expected with a new phone, tablet, etc.  The tablet is speedy, well designed, Samsung has some useful apps that come preinstalled and since I have an android phone I had my email, text messages and favorite apps up and running quickly. It is a great tablet at a reasonable price.The only negative is that the pen skips when drawing.  I decided to purchase a V-Pen to see if it was the pen or the tablet causing the problem, and the V-Pen works flawlessly with my drawing apps.  I was relieved to discover the problem was just the S pen. Product support (Samsung and Amazon) confirmed that I would have to send the tablet back in order to get a new pen (and tablet), which is the last thing I wanted to do after I had it all set up, so I decided to purchase some pen tips for the S pen to see if that fixes the problem.  The tip is wobbly, and I don't know enough about these pens to know whether or not that is normal. It's not really a problem because I like the V-Pen a lot,  but it would be nice to have a backup and know what was wrong with the S pen. (No, I'm affiliated with V Pen, it was a good choice for me!) I didn't see a need to give the tablet a less than 5 star rating because of the pen - the tablet is great, just be aware of the fact that the tablet has to go back too in the event the pen has issues and you need a new one. 5 stars!",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

8/21/2024,"I was excited to get this tablet even after reading through some negative reviews. I thought “how bad can the experience really be if this is one of the more popular Samsung tabs?”. Well, worse than I expected. The screen is not good and has uneven lighting that makes everything look washed out. I was not expecting it to be great, but I can’t believe Samsung would use this in any of their hardware. The tablet also instantly lagged upon going thru initial setup. It continued to lag and have unresponsive touches the whole time I tried to use it after setup.Three Pros I have are 1) the back facing camera quality is actually halfway decent. 2) The build quality also feels decent, as it’s a glass front and aluminum back. 3) It’s fairly lightweight.Otherwise, most things about this tablet are mediocre. Screen, speed, ram, front facing camera. I didn’t try out the charging so I can’t speak to that. For the price, most would be much better off going with the base model 9th generation iPad. The base model iPad is still high quality in most anspects and currently around the same price as this galaxy tab s6 lite. I would only consider getting this if you absolutely had to have an android tablet and your budget can’t stretch any further. But don’t expect it to come close to a more pricey android tablet or any iPad. I really think Samsung should step up their game and offer better value for their lower end tablets when it comes to hardware and experience. This isn’t it.",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
1/6/2025,"I hate how Samsung nickle and dimes you to death. Everything you need to use the table is ""sold separately"". But you don't know that till it arives and you  can't use it because you don't have the connector or usb, and don't know until you open the package. Why can't they just send you everything and raise the price, which is not cheap to begin with.",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

7/4/2024,"Prior to the Samsung S6 Lite, had the Amazon HD 10 + tablet,which was not a bad tablet for what I payed for. The S6 Lite 2024 Edition is leaps and bounds much better. Has only dual speakers not quad but the sound quality is so good helps that there is Dolby Atmos. At first was not keen on the S pen, after utilizing it found it as one of the best aspects of the S6. Having a built in GPS sensor is something I love about the tablet as I have transformed it as my main infotainment for my car and having Google maps to navigate on a 10.4 inch screen is much better than using my cell phone. Watching videos is great love the 2000 x 1200 screen resolution. Even though it only has 4 gig of ram, have not experienced any lag and being only 60 hz refresh no stutter. It's fast and snappy. Came preinstalled with Android 14, and from what I have read Samsung should support it at least up to Android 17 for the 2024 version, you may want to do your own research on it to make sure.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

I was originally looking into the ultra, but I couldn't justify the purchase when the only real differences are screen, speaker and ram related, and nothing i'll do with it will really max out the current specs. The speakers sound amazing on this thing. Most tablets just have cheap tinny speakers just to fill the spaces while the Galaxy S line seems to have had a lot of thought put into sound quality. The camera is quite decent as well. Not top of the line, but for a tablet, it takes some pretty clear photos.It charges quite fast as well, and stays charged for a while, even with heavy game play, just like my S23 U. I did about 3 hours of straight play on war universe and it was still around 80% when I shut it down.I did make sure to get an illuminated magnetic keyboard case, and a high speed 512gb Samsung Micro SD card for it.

8/23/2024,"Originally, I bought this Tablet with the intent to use it for gaming. Ultimately, I found that there is so much more you can get out of it than that.Its a very thin, lightweight tablet. The screen is an impressive size that felt larger in my hands than I had expected. I was originally considering going for the Ultra, but the size of the S9+ is more than enough for what I need. I actually feel more comfortable using this tablet without the protective case that I purchased for it when at home. I didn't even bother putting on the protective glass screen I bought for it because I don't see myself abusing this tablet as hard as I abuse my phone.The performance is fantastic. This has no problem playing whatever games you might want to play on it and the refresh rate is superb. As someone who regularly uses a high refresh rate monitor, I can appreciate seeing similar performance on a tablet.What I wasn't expecting when I bought this was how much I could get out of Samsung's Second Screen app. This built in application allows you to wirelessly connect your Samsung tablet to your PC and use it as an additional monitor. As someone who regularly uses a laptop for work, its a game changing asset to have. The integration is seamless; you can even choose to enable the touchscreen so that you could browse through documents like you would with a kindle without having to go through the hassle of doing file transfers.However with performance comes a price. It goes without saying that these tablets are pretty damn expensive. If I had to make a recommendation, I would suggest settling for the S9 which my friend bought and is more than satisfied with. Most of what you are getting out of making the jump to the S9+ or Ultra is a larger screen size. Visit your local electronics store and see which one is right for you.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

2/11/2024,"My previous Samsung Note tablet circa 2014 is very old. Not wanting to purchase a new tablet I reformatted it hopefully to bring it back to life. But its old and not useful for todays apps. About a year or more has passed before looking again at the tablet world.  I rocked a Samsung not 8 phone well past its use and recently upgraded to a S23. I absolutely love the S-pen and S-Note. My new tablet had to be pen capable. Just using a pen is way different than pen features baked into the ecosystem of the device.Enter the S9 tablet family. I played around with the idea of getting by with one from the S8 family because of expense, but I like bells and whistles. I also intend to have this tablet for many years, so OS updating is important.I picked the Samsung S9 plus. Amazon was offering it with 512gb with 13 percent off which was 30 bucks cheaper than the 256gb version. I've played the available built in storage game before.  I'll be using this tablet for a variety of functions so having the larger  space for apps and all of my projects will be nice.Test...First I charge to full capacity before turning it onI then used Samsung's transfer tool and copied my apps from my S23 to the S9 plus tablet. This worked without a hitch.Let those apps updateUpdate the OS under settingsPlay time....Audio-I read that the sound of this tablet was superb so I head to play something from my Amazon collection before heading to YouTube to play some videos. It has rich bass and volume.Video-I played a video from my digital library, Amazon, YouTube and Vudu. Colors were nice and bright so no surprises thereS-pen-Although they were creative with the magnetic back storage, I wished it was like the phone and my old tablet with the S-pen stored inside. The pen itself is pleasantly thicker than anticipated. Samsung made a good move in matching the color of both the pen and tablet. There's a lot of features to learn if you care to. The included S-notes is a beast of a program, but you can also use other programs like OneNote.The only thing with the form of this tablet is it is long horizontally. So when holding that way it seems a bit long. I rather like the more square shape of my old tablet. There's a lot to learn about the features and youtube is a great tutor. Even just now typing this out one came to me with holding down the Ctrl key. It lights up the letters y, a, z, x, c and v which are shortcuts for specific functions. Very cool!When you get it, pay attention to the return policy and use it to death within that time frame. This is already long so I may update only if I come across an issue that impacts negatively.It is pricey, but it is a premium feature tablet. You can get cheaper with going with lesser specs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
12/30/2024,"Love this tablet, it runs fast and switches smoothly from app to app. The landscape mode is the only thing I don't really like, it will only turn one direction to watch in landscape which is not convenient. I would check to see when the newest one will be released before spending over 1K on a tablet though. You could end up with an older tablet when the newest is coming out in a month or so.Battery life is great, I use it every day & listen to it all night every night. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to transport or travel with. Easily pairs with any Bluetooth keyboard and any other BT devices.",4,Galaxy Tab S9

10/26/2024,"i got sucked down the rabbit hole of digital planners and stuff from YouTube shorts, and between that and wanting to learn how to digital draw at some point, i ended up getting this on Prime Day for $750 ($794 after tax i think). I 1000% recommend getting it for that price vs the $900+ as that's so much for a previous series with the 10s out now.for that price, it's amazing. i plan to try to keep it going until 2030 just like the new PC i got in June, and if i get that much use out of it, i'll be so happy.dex mode is underrated, and all my stuff BT-connects without issuesyou can also music share with a samsung phone so they can both use the same headphones/earbuds.my friend even made a comment about how he thought it was very nice as someone who's never really gone after serious tablets before. so i take that as a win as well lol",5,Galaxy Tab S9

8/21/2024,"** 3 Month update ***I’ve set up a reliable Dex ecosystem for my Samsung tablet, Caldigit TS4 to expand the number of ports available, wired mouse and keyboard, and a monitor (HP Omen). With this setup I can run Dex flawlessly (Dex is a built in desktop operating system that comes with Samsung smart phones and tablets)My primary uses for this device are Google workspace (you have to use the chrome browser for all features, the apps are functional, but lack a lot of editing features), web based management systems, and media.The stock speakers are great (comparable to laptop speakers, a little tinny, but generally sound great for the device class)The screen is gorgeous, and as a stand alone tablet you can absolutely use Dex with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard on the fly, managing a couple windows side by side feels comfortable (not too small)Could this replace your laptop? So long as you don’t rely on specific software. Absolutely, this would be great for student or business owners on the go. Not too big to bring with you, but not too small to be unusable.This thing has exceeded my expectation for sure. Same internals as the ultra tab, smaller screen.Perfect for excel, google sheets, word processing, and when paired with mouse and keyboard is effectively functional as an ultra portable laptop.If most of your work is web based or general word processing 10/10 I’d recommend.Haven’t had any issues with lagging, overheating, or battery health.I do recommend adjusting your battery settings to prevent it from charging past 80%, and while it is convenient disabling fast charging will help preserve the battery life in the long run.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
10/4/2024,"First off this tablet is great! My recommendation is to price around once a week and see the various colors they offer. It changes! When I bought this one, the beige was cheaper than the black. Then the following week when my husband wanted one. Both of them where at the same price and a few cents more expensive then what I bought mine.I got this tablet to replace my laptop. Don't get me wrong I would rather be on my laptop but due to a wrist injury I can't lift much without help or being in pain. So this is why I got it.I'm a samsung user in general so the setup was easy for me. Everyone's learning curve is different. Wifi is good but the downside it will try to connect to everything! Even the neighbors stuff! Changing and keeping the charge is fine but it drains quickly if I'm watching youtube or playing a moblie game like Honkai: Star Rail. I think I can get 4 hours of Honkai without and be at 10%.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
8/17/2024,"Pro: Great screen and sharpness. Very fast going to any screen, browser, menu scrolling, easy to learn more about all its functions by going on YouTube. I got the 512G memory so plenty of space there. Got a nice case for it. Easy-to-use keyboard is also a plus. Synch easily to my Samsung phone as the Quick Share makes short work of transferring data and apps to this tablet. There's more positives however the fun is exploring it. Bluetooth finds your printers easily and is very useful.  Games are handled very well. Syncs to any other Samsung appliance, TV, and others. Screen protector is something you'll need to decide on. S-Pen is very useful, a learning curve is needed buy easily learned.Con: I don't like Google Sheets or Docs. Very annoying to use especially if you are used to Microsoft Works. To use MS Excel or Word here a subscription is need. Using Google Sheets and docs takes a few YouTube video searches. Can be very confusing trying to find files.No SD slot. No earphones jack. No 5G unless you specifically get one with it. Useless outdoors away from a WIFI signal. Battery does drain a little faster than I'd like and fast charging isn't really that fast.Summary: You'll like this tablet. Screen size is just right and updated regularly the functionality is very high. Screen is very reactive with touch and quick. You'll like it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9

9/17/2023,"Tablets and I typically don't get along, especially on the Android side of things, which is why my enthusiasm for this tablet has really caught me by surprise. I've owned a few Android tablets, an iPad Mini, and a little Surface tablet -- and mostly these experiences taught me that, just maybe, tablets aren't for me. I always missed having a cursor, or having a keyboard that wasn't a case, or, most of all, programs on my desktop (or even just my Chromebook). So I kind of turned my back on tablets for a while. I was using my two-in-one Samsung Chromebook 2 as a tablet, but the myriad of issues that have recently cropped up on that device made me want to try an actual tablet again.Enter the S9. I've loved this thing from the moment I unboxed it. Calling the color 'beige' almost seems like an insult; it's a nice, silvery white that really makes the device stand out, and the matching color of the S Pen is a nice touch. And the screen is absolutely gorgeous, I can't stop admiring it whenever I wake it up. The colors and brightness are really great, and you can fine tune the latter for your needs. I haven't tried using it in a full blast of sunlight, yet, but it's excelled everywhere else. Portability is a breeze since the S9 is so light. Even with the case I have for it, which adds a bit of heft, it's still much easier to carry around than my Chromebook. And the functionality! I have the Samsung Flip 5 and the Samsung Buds Live, and the S9 interfaces with both of them flawlessly. I can look at messages from my phone (and it also grabbed a bunch of info from it, saving me time) and listen to both my tablet and my phone on my Buds Live, among other things. Gone are the days that I need to pack a separate headset/earphones for my tablet and my phone. It's such a stream-lined setup, I love it.This is ordinarily where I would list all of my cons, but I don't have a lot, honestly. My only dissatisfaction is how expensive the S9's Samsung accessories are (how much for the covers? oof!), and how limited, but maybe more will spring up in time. I used to dislike how limited apps were on Android tablets, but now you can get a huge plethora of apps that connect to your destktop versions. It really just depends on what you use and how you work.So, yeah. I love this thing, as you can tell. I've written this review on it, even. If you need a tablet spruce-up in your life, and you own some other Samsung products, I recommend this one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
7/17/2024,"I mainly bought this my first tablet device to take notes on in a way that would store my notes in an easily accessible place and be available to me across devices (on my phone and PC as well). I am having trouble getting my notes from OneNote to synch to the cloud so that my other devices can see them. That is more of a software issue. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 NotePaper Screen Panel to improve the writing experience for note taking, which was an improvement. I did not love the writing experience on the bare screen. Too slippery, and too much unintentional palm interaction with screen. I also bought a Dexnor keyboard case for it, which works pretty well, but it is not a great typing experience. Just useful in a pinch. It has good battery life and seems to have good processor speed. All in all I am not sure this was a wise investment to try to transition to digital note taking, away from paper. It remains to be seen if I stick with it or switch back to paper. I have to get the synching working to stick with it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9

9/10/2024,"Finally! A tablet that delivers performance like I have never seen before in an android tablet. Fast screen refresh time and very responsive GPU and CPU. I did have a problem using the smartswitch app. While trying to use smartswitch to copy my phone contents into the tablet, the app wanted to update but was unable to. I allowed the tablet to complete its installation and initialization and when it was done, I updated the smartswitch app then tried again this time with glowing success.I have some concerns with the expected lifetime of this tablets amoled screen but I have read that Samsung has taken steps to prevent burnin and other screen problems.If you want solid performance in an android tablet then this is the one to get. I would not recommend giving this level of tablet to a child.I wold have also purchased the book case keyboard with it had it been available,",5,Galaxy Tab S9
8/21/2024,"This tablet is so fast and has a great screen and surprisingly good sound for something so thin.  A relative actually had to ask me to turn it down when I was playing a news broadcast in the next room while they were on the phone.  I wish my Chromebook sounded this good. The fingerprint sensor is super fast and reliable. It also holds a charge really well.  It doesn't run down quickly when in heavy use, and when I just leave it on for a couple days without using it much, it's still above 90 percent on Day 3.IMHO the Android system is much more user-friendly than Apple's, and I have a Samsung phone, so it was especially quick and easy to set it up with the apps I like to use -- it all transferred over by logging in, basically.  I still have to learn all the features, like using Dex, pop-up screens, and the stylus.I do like the form factor of the iPad slightly better -- prefer the more rounded edges. Otherwise, this is pretty much perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

1/1/2025,Got for Christmas to replace my other samsung tablet. It works great and is faster than my last tablet. My only problem is that they have so many different options and it is hard to get the best one. You just don't know what options are the best for your money or your just getting ripped off buy paying for something that is the same as the another one that is cheaper. Samsung changes just one word and then charges even more money for something that is the same.,3,Galaxy Tab S9
5/18/2024,"When I first started setup, I had a major issue with this product. It damped what should have been an exciting time. The tablet is definitely a superstar, but I had an issue getting the Samsung keyboard to show up. This is my 4th Samsung tablet, so it's not like I'm some newbie. I won't drag this out, but it took an online video for me to find the missing component. After that, the magic began. This is the reason that I'm giving the tablet, a definite 5 star, a 4 star rating. It shouldn't take online videos to get the startup successfully completed. I'll still buy Samsung products and still love them, but I wish this could have gone more smoothly. I definitely recommend this tablet and hope your purchase goes smoothly. ETA:  this is a rewrite of my original posting as I always want to be as fair as possible in my reviews.",4,Galaxy Tab S9
8/14/2023,"So far, the Tablet has been amazing. This is the first time I own a tablet, so I was really satisfied with the size of the S9. To be honest, I was going to buy the S9 Ultra until I realized that I just wanted it for reading and perhaps basic gaming (i.e. Dead cells, gacha games, etc.). I was worried about the S9 since I did not know what to expect for 11', but it has been great and works well. If you are planning to use the tablet as a book, video watcher, and basic gaming, I believe the S9 will suffice. Since I already have a great laptop, I realized that a bigger size was useless for me. So, the size for a consumer that is planning to use it for basic functions will be happy to know that the S9 is more than enough.I like the design of this Tablet; it looks super nice, and the included pen helps a lot when maneuvering around the screen. Actually, I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, which is old, but it came with a pen as well, but I never used it; however, with the table, I believe it is critical since it is too big for me to reach the top of the screen (And this is an 11', I cannot imagine how hard would have been if I had a bigger one).The only bad thing I can think of is not with the Table itself but with this listing, they tell you it will come with a ""FREE"" book cover, but I didn't receive it. Amazon was nice enough to give me a partial refund, but now I have no cover T_T. So yeah, don't expect a free book cover. Actually, this is why I lowered the rating since the product itself is fantastic. Nonetheless, the retailer failed to provide me with what they promised. Even when I went to their website, they didn't help at all! It was annoying since they will be like go here, go there to end up not getting anything and wasting time.TL;DR: The tablet is great, comes with a nice pen, and is beautifully designed. However, they didn't give me a book cover. Nonetheless, Amazon helped me by giving me a partial refund.",4,Galaxy Tab S9
7/29/2024,"I moved up from a 5 year old 10"" Samsung Galaxy tablet to this one and have not been disappointed. It has great color and fast processing. There are a lot of features new to this one that I still am learning to use. The S Pen is convenient and the camera takes excellent pictures. The screen is big enough and has great clarity so I can put it on my lap and watch movies in bed. The only drawbacks are the weight (it's heavy) and the battery life which I don't think is as great as Samsung promotes it to be. I did buy a protective cover for it which of course increased the weight. I bought it on sale on an Amazon Prime day so overall I'm happy with this purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
5/18/2024,"I had never been an Android tablet user and I received a Samsung A7 Lite from T-Mobile supposedly for free, but it was not free. The A7 Lite was very under powered and could not keep up with program/app demands. I had been very pleased that I could put apps on the tablet that I really did not want on my phone. I used the Fit-Bit app as well as the Toyota app quite often, but they were slow. After about 2 years and a number of app & OS updates, the Fit-Bit and Toyota apps were almost worthless; the Toyota app was taking days to update my car's charging history, and the Fit-Bit app took 3 or 4 synchronizations, and still might not be accurate; I thought the problems were with the service and not my A7 tablet. I took a chance on this S9 because it had more memory and a more powerful processor, and boy, I could not be happier. My Toyota charging history has been up to date within hours, and the Fit-Bit data is a one-and-done when synchronizing.  My old A7 would not stream my video from my Synology NSA, but the S9 has no problem. I am very, very happy with my S9 purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

I had to wait 3 days to cancel the order because it sat in some warehouse.  Then it took 10 days for them to credit my card. An item that cost $1000 and is never delivered, should be refunded right away.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
2/4/2024,"I've always bought the cheaper Samsung A series Android tablets and they've always disappointed in the long run. The S9 is just so responsive and quick at everything it does that I think it's worth the higher price. The OLED screen is excellent overall and it's just a joy to use.I tried to go the iPad route to see what all the hype was about and bought the base model 9th gen about a year ago. It was a pretty good tablet with a nice screen and decent speed, but the Apple ecosystem just wasn't for me. The S9 is better at everything and doesn't have big black bars on the sides of your videos due to Apple's unique display ratio. The 120Hz screen on the S9 is amazing. It made my iPad feel terrible to use when I went back to it for a comparison.I think most of all I missed the Google discover news feed (swipe left when on home screen). Apple news is a paid thing for most of the content and I found myself using my android phone to get my my news feed vs. my Apple tablet. The Google news app on iPad just wasn't the same. One thing I really did like about the iPad was the gestures. Turns out that android has pretty much identical gestures in the display options  and it's the best of both worlds for me on the s9 now. Don't think I'll have to upgrade for quite a while with how powerful this S9 is!",5,Galaxy Tab S9
9/6/2023,"I bought this to replace a similar Galaxy Tab S4.  Nothing wrong with the older tablet, just was ready to upgrade- five years of use and not a single problem with it!  Anyway, there is almost no question the Tab S is the best Android tablet. The LED screens are just fantastic.  This new model is even faster yet.  0.5"" bigger screen (11"" instead of 10.5"") and almost the same size and weight.I got in on the deal that increased the memory and doubled the storage for no extra charge, so an astounding 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage- both way more than I will ever need.  S-pen works very well.  Sound is great (for a tablet).  Love the new in-screen fingerprint sensor.  Micro SD card slot works perfectly.The only thing I hate is that there is no headphone jack.  Almost didn't buy it for that reason, alone.  I hate using adapters/dongles.  And to use a dongle means I have to pry out the magnetic USB charger connector I love, every time, which is very difficult to do and I will likely lose it because it is so small.  There is ZERO reason to not include a headphone jack.  There is plenty of space, and they make jacks that are just as water-resistant as the USB port.  OK, I will stop with that rant.Oh, the price is crazy too.  Most people simply will not spend this much on a tablet, opting for something like the ""A"" line instead.  This model was $200 MORE than the crazy high price of my old S4, but the screen on the ""S"" is just so nice, so I just gotta have it :)",5,Galaxy Tab S9

The pictures are crisp and the speakers are great. The S pen that comes with it is a great feature and I'm glad it comes with the tablet and isn't an add on accessory. I got the base model which is similarly sized to my S6 because it was what I could afford.  I'd like to get the bigger model (plus or ultra) but they are just cost prohibitive.  The S series still has an expandable micro SD card slot, which I use.  I'm a die hard android user, so after months of consideration, finally caved.

I wanted something portable that I could use as a computer to access my files online, work with my photos in Lightroom, and take notes or draw. I ultimately decided to go with the Tab S9 because of Samsung's strong reputation in electronics, their integration with Windows, and the DEX feature.I'm not disappointed, as the Tab S9 meets all my expectations. I’ve started bringing it to work for productivity and note-taking is fun now that my handwriting can be converted to text.

4/3/2024,"This replaced my Samsung Tab S2 (a 2016 purchase).  The best part is the rich audio, absolutely stunning (and louder than the S2 I had been using).  Thankfully my phone charger also charges this tablet, the chargers are no longer included in the box.  There is no instruction booklet either, but you can view it on the phone or download it from the Samsung web site.  The Pen is a new toy for me, and it will be a while before I learn all it can do.  The product I purchased connects by means of WiFi 6 which is fast, my old Tab was WiFi or an added component on my wireless service of my phone carrier - I found that WiFi use only is totally sufficient in our world today compared to 2016.  If I get half as many years as my Tab S2 then the cost is well worth it - though I tend to stretch use out as long as I can.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

The screen and build quality are wonderful... and the extra real estate allows for even more immersive movies and gaming.  But bigger also means more bulky and heavy to travel with, especially if you also need to be carrying a laptop.  My wife uses her tablet as her primary device, and she loves this tablet.  I appreciate it, but when I go for a long trip later this year it will be interesting to see how I feel about its bulk.

Apps open quickly and run very smoothly.I do have a gripe, however.  Samsung got rid of the headphone jack.  I recognize that this is a growing trend.  I have a USBC adapter, as well as headphone amps, so I can easily work around this.  However, I'd rather have the 3.5mm jack.

8/10/2024,"Hello, this is my first review on Amazon. This review comes courtesy of a longtime Samsung user. Included is a picture of my S9 FE+ 256GB next to my second S6 Tab Lite (I lost the first one ;( ) shot on a S20 FE 5G. I will be comparing to my S6 Tab Lite. I really like the S6 Lite. I got it for $200 at Walmart (for both S6's). For comparison, I was given a Nexus 7 back in 2012, which was also purchased for $200. The Nexus is now 12 yo, and barely works. Using the S6 has been awesome. It's only chugged during intensive moments in gaming, and it only froze for a second or two. With three times the RAM as the S6, I don't think I'll have any problems for a long time.nThe size of the S6 Tab Lite is a lot more manageable for me. I could use it (the S6) one handed if I was only really using one half of the screen. I definitely can't with this! That being said, as somebody who's working on an engineering undergrad degree, I found the screen of the S6 too small. This screen feels big enough to use on most days. And with 256 GB instead of 64 GB, I can have games and lots of notes.A few notes: the S9 pen is a bit thicker and has a smaller button than the S6 pen. Second, I was getting better rear photos on the S6 than the S9, I don't know why. I hope it's user error. I'll update you on that. Finally, the S6 feels slimmer in my hand even though they're the same thickness, thanks to the S6 having rounded corners versus the sharper/more upright edges on the S9.Conclusion: For relaxation, the S6 is better, assuming you're not playing hard-core games (it ran fine on Honkai ... on the lowest settings). For work, the extra real estate pays dividends and with a good keyboard case, should be good to replace the laptop most of the time.Proper Review:When I wrote this originally, I didn't have the Samsung portfolio case. I left a review there about a month ago. (Short and sweet: It's very expensive, but it's also perfectly suited to what I need from this device. Backlighting would be nice, but I don't find it to be as much of an issue as I did a month ago.) Update on the camera: I think I smudged up the camera when grabbing the first time. I took a picture of an outdoor scene, and although it wasn't sharp, it wasn't really fuzzy either. I haven't done a side-by-side comparrison with the S6 Lite though. I'll update this update if I determine that smudges weren't the cause of the picture quality deficit.I learned about more software features, like RAM+ and wireless mirroring. In options, it gives the ability for up to 8 GB of virtual RAM. However, I also noted that 4 GB of RAM+ was selected and turned on by default. When I turned it off, it still showed up as 12 GB. Hopefully, this means I can have 20 GB of RAM, although I can't possibly imagine I'd need that many. I've noticed that the tablet seems to use at minimum around 4-5 GB of RAM. Makes me wonder how the S6 Lite manages to run Honkai Star Rail. I've seemed to have more performance issues in games than the S6 on higher settings, but the battery life is much better. It feels like this will never die! The S6 could only do 3-4 hours of gaming, but this can do much more, I think atleast twice as much, maybe triple? This also has faster charging speeds. Let me demonstrate the battery life. I have 1hr 15 minute classes. With note-taking almost the entire time, this went down 7%. At that rate, that's probably almost 16 hours of on-screen time!This tablet really is something special, especially with the portfolio case. It's small enough that I feel comfortable walking a mile to class with this in my hands (in a 13' Macbook case lol), and it's big enough that I can get work done on it - as long as I'm not constantly switching tabs. Windows is better for rearranging tabs, although Samsung provides more freedom - I just don't find that freedom useful personally. I still stand by my opinion that gaming is easier on the smaller screen - I accidentally pressed the accelerator in RR3 numerous times on the S9 FE+, but that never happened on the S6 Lite.Anyways, that's it for me. I'd highly recommend getting the extra RAM, especially if you're like me who was raised to use stuff until it falls apart. If you're a student, I couldn't recommend this tablet more strongly.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
11/1/2024,"I absolutely love this brand's tablets. This is my second one. But probably the fourth tablet for my family to purchase. First one lasted almost three and a half years before I had trouble with it. Then another five before it gave up the ghost.I love the upgrade of the pen. This was my one big reason with go with another samsung over say a fire. And I was thrilled with how well this tablet handled my artwork.Since getting I've been on it a lot. I love the bigger screen (In comparison to my phone) The high speed under which it works.If I could change or improve this, I don't think I would. The pen was my main complaint in the past, but I am thrilled on how they included, and upgraded it and how smoothly it works.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
12/20/2024,"Like any mobile device from Samsung, this tablet is well built and will last a few years if not abused.I'm not over fond of the Samsung special apps loaded and I tend to squash any I can. This is one reason I wish I could get a Pixel tablet with the same features, I do not like bloat.Aside from the unneeded software, it's pleasing to use. Some things are different from my old Tab S-3, but it's quite a few years newer so that's expected.Of note, the included S-pen will magnetically attach to the back of your tablet. This is a nice feature but also I don't trust it to keep my pen in place. I purchased a case which takes advantage of the magnet but uses an elastic strap to ensure it stays where its supposed to be.The fingerprint reader is on the power button and I've found it both natural to use and accurate. You can adjust the navigation controls to be either a three button configuration or a gesture type. I prefer the three button. Unlike the S3, these buttons are not a part of the physical devie and instead are onscreen. This gives you the ability to both change the position of the buttons (mine are right of center) you can also change the order so the back button is on the left like most other Android devices. Oddly, I am so used to having my tablet with back button on the right instead of left that I just left it there.When I activated the mobile connection, Verizon downloaded an e-sim to it instead of using the included nano-sim. It also didn't activate immediately and I don't know why. Eventually I successfully activated it and conclude the range is just as good as my phone. I'm not 100% sure buying with the 5G mobile connection was wise, but that's a personal decision.Outside of the question of whether getting 5G was a good idea, there's no question this is a good product and worth buying.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
12/8/2024,If you are debating getting this tablet i suggest you dong and just get it! the battery life is so good it last up to two days. I use my tablet for college and for illustrations and it works like heaven. On top of this the features are so cool like veing able to use it as a computer or being able to use it as a second monitor. This feature definetly has been helpful as i work on my laptop and need noted open on the side. it’s also decently customizable bc you can change the pen cursor as you’d like. This definetly more worth it than an Ipad in comparison because you’re not spending another $100 for a pen.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
7/23/2024,"I bought this to make art and as soon as I touched the top of the S Pen to the screen I was blown away by how smooth and soft the feel is against the screen. Set up was quick and easy. It's even easier if you already have Google and Samsung accounts.It doesn't come with a charger block, only a type c to type c wire, which left me with no choice but to use a random off brand type c charger with a Samsung type A block which I hope won't mess with the battery or life span of this thing.The metallic lavender color is gorgeous and warm, quite similar to the pink HP Stream 14. The S Pen is a pastel, chalky lavender in a cooler tone.This tablet is razor thin, relatively lightweight for its size (perfect for drawing) and has a fantastic display.The user interface is typical of samsungs and androids. Unfortunately, Samsung phone themes are not compatible but you can customize the icons by selecting color schemes that match your wallpaper.Sounds quality is pretty good. It doesn't get too loud. To start, I played a mobile game and watched YouTube. Both experiences were hiccup-free and great on such a large, clear screen.The tablet comes with PENUP already on it, so artists who are just getting back into digital drawing will enjoy the app and its new, intuitive user interface.The S-pen has handwrite to text features that kick in automatically upon pairing with either your tablet or Samsung phone. I tried this S pen with both and the features come built into the pen!",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

1/6/2025,"My old Samsung tablet stopped receiving updates in 2019, so I figured it was time for a new one. After so much looking and comparing many brands and sizes, I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2023 in silver.Some of the layout and apps look similar to my old tablet, but many things have improved. The tablet seems fast, and charges fast (I purchased a fast Samsung charger separately). I like the fingerprint-scanning button (when the tablet is not locked). The S pen is responsive, even with a glass screen protector installed. I'm not into taking a lot of pictures, so the camera is fine for me. The sound is fine for me as well. since I just need the basics, nothing fancy, and I'm not a gamer.I got rid of some preinstalled apps, some that I was able to remove; others that I couldn't remove I disabled. I added some of my own apps, and added some music on an SD card. I like the note-taking app that was preinstalled.The Tab S9 is the right size for me to use as an e-book reader. I have a case with a hand strap, so I usually hold my tablet to read or check email. There are many things that can be customized on this tablet, including accessibility features. I'm liking this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
12/23/2024,"I just bought it on black Friday and I couldn't be happier about the purchase, the tablet feels very good, good quality, the Dex help mode is very useful, especially for people who need to have several apps open at once, the excellent multitasking. I haven't tried the battery as much but so far it's according to my needs, I have the 65W Samsung charger and I charge the tablet in 1h 30m, so I have no battery issues.Working with the S Pen is very comfortable, writing with it along, with palm rejection is very useful.I haven't tried it as much in games but having a common use have been very fluid the experience, The processor isn't high-end but so far I've done well in the games I've tried.What I like most is its integration with the Samsung ecosystem, I have an S22+ and passing files between devices is very easy, even to PC through Samsung Flow, the connection is very fast.For the use that the one wanted, which was basically for the University, it is really useful to take notes and work on Word or PowerPoint, even more if you add an inhalable keyboard with trackpad. Plus, it's great for watching media, with a good screen and great speakers.Being able to expand your memory using an SD card is something that is strange about today's phones and allows you to expand storage in a very easy way.I am a loyal Samsung user and I have not been disappointed with this Galaxy Tab S9 FE, if you are thinking of buying it, I recommend it.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

12/7/2024,"This purchase was for my wife for Christmas. She has previously owned two Samsung Tab As. This was a tremendous upgrade for her. She says that the operating system in almost identical to her S24 phone. My first complaint is that Samsung did not include a charging block with this device. Many of the charging blocks available on Amazon have less than stellar reviews. The buyer is left to their own devices to find the most appropriate charging block online or in a retail store. This is sad considering how many iterations of charging blocks manufacturers have gone through in the past 5 to 10 years. Another complaint is that the tab (and separately ordered accessories) arrived in a box with no cushioning material, literally clanging around but this is an Amazon problem and has nothing to do with the quality of the device.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

12/24/2024,"I used a Samsung S4 before upgrading to this one. I have had a great experience with all of my Samsung devices thus far so I was confident in buying this one. The S4 worked great for as long as I had it. The only reason I switched to this one is because I needed a bigger screen. So far, I'm loving it. The screen size is great. It is fast and has good battery life. I'm hoping to get at least as much use out of it as the previous one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
12/13/2024,"So far I love this tablet.  The 12.4"" screen size and display clarity exceeded my expectations, and the processor speed is great too!  It was very easy to import all of my items from my old Samsung tablet, so I was up and running again in no time.  Also, the sound quality blew me away, especially considering that it's coming from a tablet.  I wish it came with a case, and it would be great if it had a USB port, but those shortcomings aren't enough to keep me from being very happy with my purchase.  I would highly recommend this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

I don't want to repurchase my electronics every couple years to keep up with the new power hungry software programs. This is the top rated tablet on the market. Do your research. I researched for over 12 hours for my next tablet. I will be years before I need to go through that again with this tablet. Con: it needs 4 speakers, rather than the two that it comes with. The it would be perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

I'm not a great artist, but I feel like I can make and implement my embroidery designs much easier now.It was very easy to set up and start using.

10/24/2024,"I was down the rabbit hole on researching the best tablet or laptop for basic writing . Things that are important to me are storage, processing input, portability , durability, accessory compatibility, and  dual functionality. I've had the tablet for about 3 weeks now and I use it daily. I purchased a magnetic bluetooth keyboard for it and it has been a seemless match. The touch sensitivity is HIGH. I'm still learning how to get used to that. I'm able to have multiple screens open and split the screen to view them at once. This is incredibly important for me and what I bought the tablet for. The battery life is very nice as well. I only charge it every other day and I use it a few hours on a daily basis. Charging isn't the fastest but it holds the charge really well ! All in all, I'd say its a great purchase for simple use .",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

The tablet and smaller items were loose inside the outer packing box.I removed tablet from it's tight paper wrap to find the screen covered in fingerprints.Also, one tiny scratch on the back, about an inch long, otherwise it looks brand new.I suspect it was opened gently, fondled admiringly, then regret-returned, but who knows?It hardly seems worth returning for a new one, but Amazon, my friend, you get a 0/5 on this one.I can't give that kind of oversight a free pass, hence the review.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

12/12/2024,I'm glad I ordered this. Samsung is a excellent brand. I haven't discovered how to reduce the screen sensitivity. It seems that anything lightly brushing across the screen produces unintentional results. Don't know if that is correctable. I also don't care for the shutting down process.

10/16/2023,"Updates will be posted on the top.Update #3 12/07/23My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0  Quick download and install no problems.Update #2 10/30/23I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow.  One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the ""strict power saving"" mode.  i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app.  So, I changed the power saving mode to ""optimizzed' and everything worked fine.Update #1 - 10/19/23.I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger.  It took 50 minutes.  The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.It came a day early.  The packaging was excellent.I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8.  I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9"" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger.  The battery was at 51%.  I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick.  I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8.  The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying.  it went pretty quick.All the apps except two copied.  One for some reason is not compatible with the S9.  The other I was able to install from Google Play.  After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps.  The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8.  At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem.  The extra .4"" in the display over the A8 is nice.  The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.I haven't tried any games since I don't play them.  I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.As far as the OS goes.  It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1.  However, the Android security update was Aug 1st.  I imagine it will update soon enough.  Google Play was June 2023.  It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.That is it for now.  I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.Another excellent product from Samsung.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

8/24/2024,"For a long time, I was strongly considering purchasing a new laptop computer.  I looked at and pondered over the many choices before finally deciding on choosing a new tablet.  I'm so glad I made that decision!The thing I love most about this tablet is its size!  It's about the same size as a small laptop, but with all the advantages of the Android platform.  I love Android!This tablet is fast, and there is a ton of storage space.  The only negative I have found is the same as on my previous Samsung tablet:  Some keys on the keyboard are ""wonky"" (for lack of a better word).  By this I mean, that when typing on the touchscreen, there are times when the key pressed results in a different letter, or even a number.  The ""T,"" for example, will often result in the number ""5,"" right above it.  I'm sure this is my fault somehow,  but it's irritating, nonetheless.Other than that small, occasional issue, I find this tablet to be a cut above my previous Samsung tablet, which had served me well, also.  But, it was time for an upgrade!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
12/20/2024,The big screen make the wonderful view,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
10/30/2024,"I’m making this review on the S9 tablet even though it was returned.  The tablet works great, the visuals are nice. The reason for the return is that it was too large and cumbersome for the individual who was going to use it.  He needed a smaller tablet to use.  This definitely is a good tablet.  I gave it four stars only because it was too large.  Otherwise it is worth 5 stars.",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
10/2/2024,"When my previous Galaxy tablet with S Pen began failing, I found out they no longer made that size tablet, with the minimum now being 10.9"", and I wasn't sure I was going to like it.I don't.  I LOVE IT!  Crisp display, smarter ""Smart Switch"" and built-in technology to lead you through initial setup than I remember from previous upgrades, made the changeover completely painless. Took a 1 TB memory card without issue.  Sound is better than you'd expect from a tablet this size, certainly superior to my old model.  S Pen feels sturdier (especially the pen tip) than others I've had.All in all, a great addition to the Galaxy family of Tablets with S Pen.A few weeks later:Love my Tab more than ever, every day I use it. Someone asked a question (which I was unable to answer or find again) about OTG adapter use. I put in an adapter and added on a 2 TB external SSD with no issues, was able to effect file transfers, play music off the external drive, with no issues. If you need more than the 1 TB that you can add as internal storage, no worries, theres's always a way to access more storage.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
11/16/2024,"I am so glad I went ahead and bought this tablet. My last tablet was a Samsung from Verizon. Unfortunately, it and its case have seen better days.

It’s a very fun and unique tablet , it’s very handy if you need something that’s handy for school and for games !!! I definitely recommend it",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
7/29/2024,"This tablet is more than enough for my needs.The speed, graphics, crisp and vibrant screen, all make for a wonderful experience. I was originally looking into the ultra, but I couldn't justify the purchase when the only real differences are screen, speaker and ram related, and nothing i'll do with it will really max out the current specs. The speakers sound amazing on this thing. Most tablets just have cheap tinny speakers just to fill the spaces while the Galaxy S line seems to have had a lot of thought put into sound quality. The camera is quite decent as well. Not top of the line, but for a tablet, it takes some pretty clear photos.It charges quite fast as well, and stays charged for a while, even with heavy game play, just like my S23 U. I did about 3 hours of straight play on war universe and it was still around 80% when I shut it down.I did make sure to get an illuminated magnetic keyboard case, and a high speed 512gb Samsung Micro SD card for it. Don't need them, just wanted to get them and got a good deal. The next thing I get will be a bluetooth mouse to complete the laptop feel. lolThis is the best tablet for the money in my eyes.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
10/16/2024,"Bought this tablet to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 which wasn't able to be updated any more. The S9 is noticeably faster and the video quality is excellent, seemingly even better than the S6. I use VLC software to play videos and the new tablet shows no lag and no drops/stalls. Transferring my data from the S6 was done using SmartSwitch (highly recommended) and the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with the S9. This was really very fast. Loading new videos to the S9 from my PC was also fast, much faster than for the S6. No issues at all. Highly recommended.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
8/23/2024,"Originally, I bought this Tablet with the intent to use it for gaming. Ultimately, I found that there is so much more you can get out of it than that.Its a very thin, lightweight tablet. The screen is an impressive size that felt larger in my hands than I had expected. I was originally considering going for the Ultra, but the size of the S9+ is more than enough for what I need. I actually feel more comfortable using this tablet without the protective case that I purchased for it when at home. I didn't even bother putting on the protective glass screen I bought for it because I don't see myself abusing this tablet as hard as I abuse my phone.The performance is fantastic. This has no problem playing whatever games you might want to play on it and the refresh rate is superb. As someone who regularly uses a high refresh rate monitor, I can appreciate seeing similar performance on a tablet.What I wasn't expecting when I bought this was how much I could get out of Samsung's Second Screen app. This built in application allows you to wirelessly connect your Samsung tablet to your PC and use it as an additional monitor. As someone who regularly uses a laptop for work, its a game changing asset to have. The integration is seamless; you can even choose to enable the touchscreen so that you could browse through documents like you would with a kindle without having to go through the hassle of doing file transfers.However with performance comes a price. It goes without saying that these tablets are pretty damn expensive. If I had to make a recommendation, I would suggest settling for the S9 which my friend bought and is more than satisfied with. Most of what you are getting out of making the jump to the S9+ or Ultra is a larger screen size. Visit your local electronics store and see which one is right for you.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
9/6/2024,"In today's tech market, all products are expensive.  The Samsung Tab S9 is an amazing device and out performs all other tablets, imo.

For a Dex experience, a portable keypad for example, Dexnor or similar is recommended.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
2/11/2024,"My previous Samsung Note tablet circa 2014 is very old. Not wanting to purchase a new tablet I reformatted it hopefully to bring it back to life. But its old and not useful for todays apps. About a year or more has passed before looking again at the tablet world.  I rocked a Samsung not 8 phone well past its use and recently upgraded to a S23. I absolutely love the S-pen and S-Note. My new tablet had to be pen capable. Just using a pen is way different than pen features baked into the ecosystem of the device.Enter the S9 tablet family. I played around with the idea of getting by with one from the S8 family because of expense, but I like bells and whistles. I also intend to have this tablet for many years, so OS updating is important.I picked the Samsung S9 plus. Amazon was offering it with 512gb with 13 percent off which was 30 bucks cheaper than the 256gb version. I've played the available built in storage game before.  I'll be using this tablet for a variety of functions so having the larger  space for apps and all of my projects will be nice.Test...First I charge to full capacity before turning it onI then used Samsung's transfer tool and copied my apps from my S23 to the S9 plus tablet. This worked without a hitch.Let those apps updateUpdate the OS under settingsPlay time....Audio-I read that the sound of this tablet was superb so I head to play something from my Amazon collection before heading to YouTube to play some videos. It has rich bass and volume.Video-I played a video from my digital library, Amazon, YouTube and Vudu. Colors were nice and bright so no surprises thereS-pen-Although they were creative with the magnetic back storage, I wished it was like the phone and my old tablet with the S-pen stored inside. The pen itself is pleasantly thicker than anticipated. Samsung made a good move in matching the color of both the pen and tablet. There's a lot of features to learn if you care to. The included S-notes is a beast of a program, but you can also use other programs like OneNote.The only thing with the form of this tablet is it is long horizontally. So when holding that way it seems a bit long. I rather like the more square shape of my old tablet. There's a lot to learn about the features and youtube is a great tutor. Even just now typing this out one came to me with holding down the Ctrl key. It lights up the letters y, a, z, x, c and v which are shortcuts for specific functions. Very cool!When you get it, pay attention to the return policy and use it to death within that time frame. This is already long so I may update only if I come across an issue that impacts negatively.It is pricey, but it is a premium feature tablet. You can get cheaper with going with lesser specs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
12/30/2024,"Love this tablet, it runs fast and switches smoothly from app to app. The landscape mode is the only thing I don't really like, it will only turn one direction to watch in landscape which is not convenient. I would check to see when the newest one will be released before spending over 1K on a tablet though. You could end up with an older tablet when the newest is coming out in a month or so.Battery life is great, I use it every day & listen to it all night every night. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to transport or travel with. Easily pairs with any Bluetooth keyboard and any other BT devices.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
1/10/2025,"My wife loves the performance, light weight, did I mention the amazing speed?

She is very impressed with the performance and thorough features of the operating system.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
12/28/2024,This is one of the best purchases I have made over the last few years. Served me well for my productivity. Allows me to get work done out of my desk.

10/26/2024,"i got sucked down the rabbit hole of digital planners and stuff from YouTube shorts, and between that and wanting to learn how to digital draw at some point, i ended up getting this on Prime Day for $750 ($794 after tax i think). I 1000% recommend getting it for that price vs the $900+ as that's so much for a previous series with the 10s out now.for that price, it's amazing. i plan to try to keep it going until 2030 just like the new PC i got in June, and if i get that much use out of it, i'll be so happy.dex mode is underrated, and all my stuff BT-connects without issuesyou can also music share with a samsung phone so they can both use the same headphones/earbuds.my friend even made a comment about how he thought it was very nice as someone who's never really gone after serious tablets before. so i take that as a win as well lol",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

8/21/2024,"** 3 Month update ***I’ve set up a reliable Dex ecosystem for my Samsung tablet, Caldigit TS4 to expand the number of ports available, wired mouse and keyboard, and a monitor (HP Omen). With this setup I can run Dex flawlessly (Dex is a built in desktop operating system that comes with Samsung smart phones and tablets)My primary uses for this device are Google workspace (you have to use the chrome browser for all features, the apps are functional, but lack a lot of editing features), web based management systems, and media.The stock speakers are great (comparable to laptop speakers, a little tinny, but generally sound great for the device class)The screen is gorgeous, and as a stand alone tablet you can absolutely use Dex with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard on the fly, managing a couple windows side by side feels comfortable (not too small)Could this replace your laptop? So long as you don’t rely on specific software. Absolutely, this would be great for student or business owners on the go. Not too big to bring with you, but not too small to be unusable.This thing has exceeded my expectation for sure. Same internals as the ultra tab, smaller screen.Perfect for excel, google sheets, word processing, and when paired with mouse and keyboard is effectively functional as an ultra portable laptop.If most of your work is web based or general word processing 10/10 I’d recommend.Haven’t had any issues with lagging, overheating, or battery health.I do recommend adjusting your battery settings to prevent it from charging past 80%, and while it is convenient disabling fast charging will help preserve the battery life in the long run.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
10/4/2024,"First off this tablet is great! My recommendation is to price around once a week and see the various colors they offer. It changes! When I bought this one, the beige was cheaper than the black. Then the following week when my husband wanted one. Both of them where at the same price and a few cents more expensive then what I bought mine.I got this tablet to replace my laptop. Don't get me wrong I would rather be on my laptop but due to a wrist injury I can't lift much without help or being in pain. So this is why I got it.I'm a samsung user in general so the setup was easy for me. Everyone's learning curve is different. Wifi is good but the downside it will try to connect to everything! Even the neighbors stuff! Changing and keeping the charge is fine but it drains quickly if I'm watching youtube or playing a moblie game like Honkai: Star Rail. I think I can get 4 hours of Honkai without and be at 10%.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
8/17/2024,"Pro: Great screen and sharpness. Very fast going to any screen, browser, menu scrolling, easy to learn more about all its functions by going on YouTube. I got the 512G memory so plenty of space there. Got a nice case for it. Easy-to-use keyboard is also a plus. Synch easily to my Samsung phone as the Quick Share makes short work of transferring data and apps to this tablet. There's more positives however the fun is exploring it. Bluetooth finds your printers easily and is very useful.  Games are handled very well. Syncs to any other Samsung appliance, TV, and others. Screen protector is something you'll need to decide on. S-Pen is very useful, a learning curve is needed buy easily learned.Con: I don't like Google Sheets or Docs. Very annoying to use especially if you are used to Microsoft Works. To use MS Excel or Word here a subscription is need. Using Google Sheets and docs takes a few YouTube video searches. Can be very confusing trying to find files.No SD slot. No earphones jack. No 5G unless you specifically get one with it. Useless outdoors away from a WIFI signal. Battery does drain a little faster than I'd like and fast charging isn't really that fast.Summary: You'll like this tablet. Screen size is just right and updated regularly the functionality is very high. Screen is very reactive with touch and quick. You'll like it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+

9/17/2023,"Tablets and I typically don't get along, especially on the Android side of things, which is why my enthusiasm for this tablet has really caught me by surprise. I've owned a few Android tablets, an iPad Mini, and a little Surface tablet -- and mostly these experiences taught me that, just maybe, tablets aren't for me. I always missed having a cursor, or having a keyboard that wasn't a case, or, most of all, programs on my desktop (or even just my Chromebook). So I kind of turned my back on tablets for a while. I was using my two-in-one Samsung Chromebook 2 as a tablet, but the myriad of issues that have recently cropped up on that device made me want to try an actual tablet again.Enter the S9. I've loved this thing from the moment I unboxed it. Calling the color 'beige' almost seems like an insult; it's a nice, silvery white that really makes the device stand out, and the matching color of the S Pen is a nice touch. And the screen is absolutely gorgeous, I can't stop admiring it whenever I wake it up. The colors and brightness are really great, and you can fine tune the latter for your needs. I haven't tried using it in a full blast of sunlight, yet, but it's excelled everywhere else. Portability is a breeze since the S9 is so light. Even with the case I have for it, which adds a bit of heft, it's still much easier to carry around than my Chromebook. And the functionality! I have the Samsung Flip 5 and the Samsung Buds Live, and the S9 interfaces with both of them flawlessly. I can look at messages from my phone (and it also grabbed a bunch of info from it, saving me time) and listen to both my tablet and my phone on my Buds Live, among other things. Gone are the days that I need to pack a separate headset/earphones for my tablet and my phone. It's such a stream-lined setup, I love it.This is ordinarily where I would list all of my cons, but I don't have a lot, honestly. My only dissatisfaction is how expensive the S9's Samsung accessories are (how much for the covers? oof!), and how limited, but maybe more will spring up in time. I used to dislike how limited apps were on Android tablets, but now you can get a huge plethora of apps that connect to your destktop versions. It really just depends on what you use and how you work.So, yeah. I love this thing, as you can tell. I've written this review on it, even. If you need a tablet spruce-up in your life, and you own some other Samsung products, I recommend this one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
7/17/2024,"I mainly bought this my first tablet device to take notes on in a way that would store my notes in an easily accessible place and be available to me across devices (on my phone and PC as well). I am having trouble getting my notes from OneNote to synch to the cloud so that my other devices can see them. That is more of a software issue. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 NotePaper Screen Panel to improve the writing experience for note taking, which was an improvement. I did not love the writing experience on the bare screen. Too slippery, and too much unintentional palm interaction with screen. I also bought a Dexnor keyboard case for it, which works pretty well, but it is not a great typing experience. Just useful in a pinch. It has good battery life and seems to have good processor speed. All in all I am not sure this was a wise investment to try to transition to digital note taking, away from paper. It remains to be seen if I stick with it or switch back to paper. I have to get the synching working to stick with it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+

9/10/2024,"Finally! A tablet that delivers performance like I have never seen before in an android tablet. Fast screen refresh time and very responsive GPU and CPU. I did have a problem using the smartswitch app. While trying to use smartswitch to copy my phone contents into the tablet, the app wanted to update but was unable to. I allowed the tablet to complete its installation and initialization and when it was done, I updated the smartswitch app then tried again this time with glowing success.I have some concerns with the expected lifetime of this tablets amoled screen but I have read that Samsung has taken steps to prevent burnin and other screen problems.If you want solid performance in an android tablet then this is the one to get. I would not recommend giving this level of tablet to a child.I wold have also purchased the book case keyboard with it had it been available,",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
8/21/2024,"This tablet is so fast and has a great screen and surprisingly good sound for something so thin.  A relative actually had to ask me to turn it down when I was playing a news broadcast in the next room while they were on the phone.  I wish my Chromebook sounded this good. The fingerprint sensor is super fast and reliable. It also holds a charge really well.  It doesn't run down quickly when in heavy use, and when I just leave it on for a couple days without using it much, it's still above 90 percent on Day 3.IMHO the Android system is much more user-friendly than Apple's, and I have a Samsung phone, so it was especially quick and easy to set it up with the apps I like to use -- it all transferred over by logging in, basically.  I still have to learn all the features, like using Dex, pop-up screens, and the stylus.I do like the form factor of the iPad slightly better -- prefer the more rounded edges. Otherwise, this is pretty much perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

Excellent blacks and the 4k is mind blowing,  you can't go wrong with Samsung!

1/1/2025,Got for Christmas to replace my other samsung tablet. It works great and is faster than my last tablet. My only problem is that they have so many different options and it is hard to get the best one. You just don't know what options are the best for your money or your just getting ripped off buy paying for something that is the same as the another one that is cheaper. Samsung changes just one word and then charges even more money for something that is the same.,3,Galaxy Tab S9+
5/18/2024,"When I first started setup, I had a major issue with this product. It damped what should have been an exciting time. The tablet is definitely a superstar, but I had an issue getting the Samsung keyboard to show up. This is my 4th Samsung tablet, so it's not like I'm some newbie. I won't drag this out, but it took an online video for me to find the missing component. After that, the magic began. This is the reason that I'm giving the tablet, a definite 5 star, a 4 star rating. It shouldn't take online videos to get the startup successfully completed. I'll still buy Samsung products and still love them, but I wish this could have gone more smoothly. I definitely recommend this tablet and hope your purchase goes smoothly. ETA:  this is a rewrite of my original posting as I always want to be as fair as possible in my reviews.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
8/14/2023,"So far, the Tablet has been amazing. This is the first time I own a tablet, so I was really satisfied with the size of the S9. To be honest, I was going to buy the S9 Ultra until I realized that I just wanted it for reading and perhaps basic gaming (i.e. Dead cells, gacha games, etc.). I was worried about the S9 since I did not know what to expect for 11', but it has been great and works well. If you are planning to use the tablet as a book, video watcher, and basic gaming, I believe the S9 will suffice. Since I already have a great laptop, I realized that a bigger size was useless for me. So, the size for a consumer that is planning to use it for basic functions will be happy to know that the S9 is more than enough.I like the design of this Tablet; it looks super nice, and the included pen helps a lot when maneuvering around the screen. Actually, I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, which is old, but it came with a pen as well, but I never used it; however, with the table, I believe it is critical since it is too big for me to reach the top of the screen (And this is an 11', I cannot imagine how hard would have been if I had a bigger one).The only bad thing I can think of is not with the Table itself but with this listing, they tell you it will come with a ""FREE"" book cover, but I didn't receive it. Amazon was nice enough to give me a partial refund, but now I have no cover T_T. So yeah, don't expect a free book cover. Actually, this is why I lowered the rating since the product itself is fantastic. Nonetheless, the retailer failed to provide me with what they promised. Even when I went to their website, they didn't help at all! It was annoying since they will be like go here, go there to end up not getting anything and wasting time.TL;DR: The tablet is great, comes with a nice pen, and is beautifully designed. However, they didn't give me a book cover. Nonetheless, Amazon helped me by giving me a partial refund.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
7/29/2024,"I moved up from a 5 year old 10"" Samsung Galaxy tablet to this one and have not been disappointed. It has great color and fast processing. There are a lot of features new to this one that I still am learning to use. The S Pen is convenient and the camera takes excellent pictures. The screen is big enough and has great clarity so I can put it on my lap and watch movies in bed. The only drawbacks are the weight (it's heavy) and the battery life which I don't think is as great as Samsung promotes it to be. I did buy a protective cover for it which of course increased the weight. I bought it on sale on an Amazon Prime day so overall I'm happy with this purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
5/18/2024,"I had never been an Android tablet user and I received a Samsung A7 Lite from T-Mobile supposedly for free, but it was not free. The A7 Lite was very under powered and could not keep up with program/app demands. I had been very pleased that I could put apps on the tablet that I really did not want on my phone. I used the Fit-Bit app as well as the Toyota app quite often, but they were slow. After about 2 years and a number of app & OS updates, the Fit-Bit and Toyota apps were almost worthless; the Toyota app was taking days to update my car's charging history, and the Fit-Bit app took 3 or 4 synchronizations, and still might not be accurate; I thought the problems were with the service and not my A7 tablet. I took a chance on this S9 because it had more memory and a more powerful processor, and boy, I could not be happier. My Toyota charging history has been up to date within hours, and the Fit-Bit data is a one-and-done when synchronizing.  My old A7 would not stream my video from my Synology NSA, but the S9 has no problem. I am very, very happy with my S9 purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
9/16/2024,"Its a Samsung so you know it is a great quality tablet. Super fast and holds a charge for a long time. Screen makes images look great. I did reject the order because it was supposed to be overnight and I needed it. I went to Best Buy and bought it there. Amazon is getting bad on actually getting you the order overnight.  I had to wait 3 days to cancel the order because it sat in some warehouse.  Then it took 10 days for them to credit my card. An item that cost $1000 and is never delivered, should be refunded right away.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
2/4/2024,"I've always bought the cheaper Samsung A series Android tablets and they've always disappointed in the long run. The S9 is just so responsive and quick at everything it does that I think it's worth the higher price. The OLED screen is excellent overall and it's just a joy to use.I tried to go the iPad route to see what all the hype was about and bought the base model 9th gen about a year ago. It was a pretty good tablet with a nice screen and decent speed, but the Apple ecosystem just wasn't for me. The S9 is better at everything and doesn't have big black bars on the sides of your videos due to Apple's unique display ratio. The 120Hz screen on the S9 is amazing. It made my iPad feel terrible to use when I went back to it for a comparison.I think most of all I missed the Google discover news feed (swipe left when on home screen). Apple news is a paid thing for most of the content and I found myself using my android phone to get my my news feed vs. my Apple tablet. The Google news app on iPad just wasn't the same. One thing I really did like about the iPad was the gestures. Turns out that android has pretty much identical gestures in the display options  and it's the best of both worlds for me on the s9 now. Don't think I'll have to upgrade for quite a while with how powerful this S9 is!",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
9/6/2023,"I bought this to replace a similar Galaxy Tab S4.  Nothing wrong with the older tablet, just was ready to upgrade- five years of use and not a single problem with it!  Anyway, there is almost no question the Tab S is the best Android tablet. The LED screens are just fantastic.  This new model is even faster yet.  0.5"" bigger screen (11"" instead of 10.5"") and almost the same size and weight.I got in on the deal that increased the memory and doubled the storage for no extra charge, so an astounding 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage- both way more than I will ever need.  S-pen works very well.  Sound is great (for a tablet).  Love the new in-screen fingerprint sensor.  Micro SD card slot works perfectly.The only thing I hate is that there is no headphone jack.  Almost didn't buy it for that reason, alone.  I hate using adapters/dongles.  And to use a dongle means I have to pry out the magnetic USB charger connector I love, every time, which is very difficult to do and I will likely lose it because it is so small.  There is ZERO reason to not include a headphone jack.  There is plenty of space, and they make jacks that are just as water-resistant as the USB port.  OK, I will stop with that rant.Oh, the price is crazy too.  Most people simply will not spend this much on a tablet, opting for something like the ""A"" line instead.  This model was $200 MORE than the crazy high price of my old S4, but the screen on the ""S"" is just so nice, so I just gotta have it :)",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

The pictures are crisp and the speakers are great. The S pen that comes with it is a great feature and I'm glad it comes with the tablet and isn't an add on accessory. I got the base model which is similarly sized to my S6 because it was what I could afford.  I'd like to get the bigger model (plus or ultra) but they are just cost prohibitive.  The S series still has an expandable micro SD card slot, which I use.  I'm a die hard android user, so after months of consideration, finally caved.  Gave my daughter the S6 and now we are both happy.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

I wanted something portable that I could use as a computer to access my files online, work with my photos in Lightroom, and take notes or draw. I ultimately decided to go with the Tab S9 because of Samsung's strong reputation in electronics, their integration with Windows, and the DEX feature.I'm not disappointed, as the Tab S9 meets all my expectations. I’ve started bringing it to work for productivity and note-taking is fun now that my handwriting can be converted to text. However, Android software is not Windows, and trying to replicate my PC experience on the tablet has encountered some roadblocks. Fortunately, there is always a workaround.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
4/3/2024,"This replaced my Samsung Tab S2 (a 2016 purchase).  The best part is the rich audio, absolutely stunning (and louder than the S2 I had been using).  Thankfully my phone charger also charges this tablet, the chargers are no longer included in the box.  There is no instruction booklet either, but you can view it on the phone or download it from the Samsung web site.  The Pen is a new toy for me, and it will be a while before I learn all it can do.  The product I purchased connects by means of WiFi 6 which is fast, my old Tab was WiFi or an added component on my wireless service of my phone carrier - I found that WiFi use only is totally sufficient in our world today compared to 2016.  If I get half as many years as my Tab S2 then the cost is well worth it - though I tend to stretch use out as long as I can.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
6/3/2024,"It's a nice improvement over my tab S5. which is still working perfectly,  I only upgraded because the support period for software updates and security ran out on my older model.

The screen and build quality are wonderful... and the extra real estate allows for even more immersive movies and gaming.  But bigger also means more bulky and heavy to travel with, especially if you also need to be carrying a laptop.  My wife uses her tablet as her primary device, and she loves this tablet.  I appreciate it, but when I go for a long trip later this year it will be interesting to see how I feel about its bulk.

2/19/2024,"Just got this today & WOW!  It's been quite a long time since I've had a tablet and this thing is crazy!  I was thinking I might regret getting the Plus vs. the Ultra because of the screen size, but the 12.4"" is perfect (I looked at it compared to the 14.4"" screen on my Lenovo laptop, and quickly realized that the 14.6 S9 Ultra would have been far too big and heavy for what I wanted).  I  The screen and lightweight are the two things that blew me away at first.  It was very easy to sync absolutely everything with my new S24 Ultra.  I'm looking forward to getting the tempered glass screen protector and magnetic Dexnor Case with built  in keyboard/S Pen holder tomorrow (as well as the new Watch6).  This tablet is an Android freak's (like me) dream come true.  Now I won't miss my Fold 4 as the S24 Ultra and Tab 6 Plus seem to compliment each other very well.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

10/2/2024,"The magnet on the pen is not strong enough to hold it on the tablet when moving the tablet through the day. I have now lost two pens since August 25th. These pens are too expensive to have to keep replacing them. They should come with a find my pen and also there should be a slot in the tablet for the pen to go in.

6/12/2024,"I bought this as an extra tool for my drawing as an alternative to an iPad pro. I am very happy with my purchase, it runs smoothly, has an excellent battery life and is in my opinion easier to use and navigate than an actual iPad. If you're looking for quality at a lower price, then this will definitely get the job done. Plus it comes with the pen included.

As far as Apple is concerned,  i will never buy another Apple device, their relationship with Chinese Communist Party is too cozy for me. i am a basic user with my tablets, emails , Outlook,  Amazon, banking etc. But back to the quad speakers,  the sound leaves me speechless.  Oh yes, Kindle books , the strain on one's eyes was a major decision.

The tablet itself is very well made, feels sturdy and looks great.  Images and videos look wonderful.  This tablet also has quite a bit of power.  Apps open quickly and run very smoothly.I do have a gripe, however.  Samsung got rid of the headphone jack.  I recognize that this is a growing trend.  I have a USBC adapter, as well as headphone amps, so I can easily work around this.  However, I'd rather have the 3.5mm jack.

I actually had to reduce the brightness setting by a hefty amount to be comfortable for my eyes, and the built in speakers are sufficient that you really don't need to pair them to an external sound system to enjoy listening to music.If it continues to operate this well over time I will be a Samsung Galaxy tablet customer for life.You've got a great product here Samsung, don't mess it up by ""fixing"" it until it's broke.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

Graphics very good and copes with everything but the serious gaming level, which would cost much more. It has a super metal alloy finish, and good quality glass, so get it protected with a tempered glass screen protector, and case for the Tablet body I think the likes of Samsung are going to be forced into dropping their prices, as an equivalent would be in the £500+ range, I used to buy Samsung tablets and their very good, but so are these with equivalent build and performance, plus being much cheaper. It arrives in a heavy stock cardboard box, and nicely packaged. Its rated as 10 WATT charging, but I can tell you if you get a 20 Watt charger you'll receive 17 watt charging fate, with ""fast charging"" appearing on the screen, so it can be charged respectively fast enough so not to hinder usage, buy a 3 meter lead and use while charging so you've plenty of lead to move about with. Comes preloaded with a latest version of Android, and receives regular updates. Plus it has a nice cleaning app built in. With very little blotware Apps..

9/5/2024,"Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE: A Budget Champion When it comes to affordable Android tablets, we often expect a familiar story: mediocre build quality, outdated internals, sluggish performance, and a short lifespan. But the Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE defies those expectations. It's the first Xiaomi device I've used, and I must say, I'm impressed—even though this is a budget tablet1. Here's why the Redmi Pad SE stands out: Impressive 90Hz Refresh Rate: What sets this tablet apart in its price range is its 90Hz refresh rate. Most budget-friendly tablets stick to the standard 60Hz, but the Redmi Pad SE steps up the game. With smoother animations, fluid transitions, and remarkably responsive scrolling, it feels surprisingly premium2. Solid Build Quality: The metal body of the Redmi Pad SE feels good in hand. Xiaomi didn't compromise on materials, and it shows. You won't mistake it for a flimsy paperweight anytime soon. Decent Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 4G, the tablet handles everyday tasks well. Whether you're browsing, streaming, or multitasking, it won't leave you frustrated. Multimedia Features: Quad Speakers: The Redmi Pad SE boasts quad speakers, making media consumption enjoyable. Expandable Storage: With 128GB of storage (expandable via microSD card), you won't run out of space for your apps and files. High-Refresh Display: The 11-inch IPS LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate ensures a pleasant viewing experience. Affordable Price: The Redmi Pad SE won't break the bank. At around $240 for the 128GB/8GB model, it's easy on your wallet. Plus, you get three color options: Mint Green, Graphite Gray, and Lavender Purple. Of course, there are some trade-offs: Graphics performance isn't mind-blowing. No official support for an active stylus. No fingerprint scanner.",5,Redmi Pad SE

6/3/2024,"Ich habe mir verschieden Tablets angeschaut.1. Lincplus T32. Xiaomi Redmi Pab SE3. Doogee T30 ProIch habe bisher das Medapad M5 lite LTE von Huawei seit Ende 2019. Leider fängt der Akku inzwischen zu schwächeln und Arbeitsspeicher, CPU und OS sind mitlerweile doch out. Da musste was neues her.Das Lincplus günstig mit 116,-€ aber Lautsprecher mies, Bild zu dunkel und keine Hoffnung auf Firmware Updates. Ging dann umgehend zuück.Das Redmi Pad hat sich gleich auf Android 14 upgedatet. Laut Website gibt es updates bis September 2026. Mit 8GB Ram und 256GB speicher auch für die nächste Zeit wohl ausreichend. Die CPU ist für mich vermutlich ausreichend schnell. Manchmal scheint das scrollen zu stocken, aber das kann auch an dem sehr glatten touch liegen. Der Sound wird mit dolby Atmos und Loudnes Funktion beworben. Besser wird es mit dem eingbauten Equalizer oder mit wavelet.Das Tablet ist sehr handlich aber ein bißchen eckig. 2 oder 3 Seiten der Einstellungen werden nur im Porträt-Modus angezeigt. Es kommt ohne Mobilfunk und erstaunlicherweise ohne Vibrationsmotor. Google Apps wie youtube, Google TV, Google Meet, Google One etc lassen weder deinstallieren noch deaktivieren. Wer es braucht ok, aber mich stört es wenn bei app updates diese dann angezeigt werden.Das Bild ist hell und die Farben ok aber nicht großartig unterschiedlich zum Doogee.Das Doogee macht einen guten Eindruck. Es ist wirklich sehr schnell und alle unerwünschten Google Apps lassen sich deaktivieren. Leider hat sich die Firmware nicht wie erwartet auf Android 14 aktualisiert. Mit der Anfrage an den Doogee Support bekam ich einen link zum Download der 14er Android Version (siehe Screenshots). Die beigefügte Anleitung ist nicht ganz klar, aber man kann sich das erarbeiten. Trotz der beworbenen Hifi Lautsprecher ist der der Klang blechern und auch mit den zwei Einstellungen zur Klangverbesserung nicht berauschend. Mit der App Wavelet (Equalizer) läßt sich das gröbste dann beheben. Die beigelegte Hülle stinkt leider stark. Beim ersten vollständigen Aufladen werden 100% angezeigt, wenn der Akku laut Accubattery app 6550 mAh anzeigt. Das Laden geht dann noch langsam weiter. Ich habe dann bei 7200 mAh Anzeige das Laden gestoppt. Angegeben sind 8500mAh. Das könnte sich mit mehrmaligen Laden noch verbessern.Das Bild ist bei normalen Gebrauch Innen hell genug. Die Farben lassen über 15 Stufen von warm nach kalt einstellen. Die automatische Helligkeit ragiert etwas sprunghaft. Das Tablet wird mitsammt der Hülle doch etwas schwer mit einer Hand zu halten.Ich häte nicht gedacht dass mir die Wahl eines neuen Tablets schwer fällt.Highlights are for Websurfen, Music videos and Prime Videos. Beruflich bedingt bin ich viel im Hotel und nicht überall kann an einen Firestick anschließen, daher ist mir ein guter Klang wichtig. Mein Mediapad hat ohne Klangeinstellung einen wesentlich bebesseren Klang (beworben mit Harman-Kardon), also fehlt mir zum schnellen Aufwecken bei allen Geräten ein Fingerabdrucksensor. Das M5 lite hat damals mit lte €229 gekostet und ich würde es mir mit etwas mehr Leistung und Speicher sofort wieder kaufen.|",4,Redmi Pad SE

1/8/2025,"The Redmi Pad SE is a decent mid-range tablet for someone who isn't too demanding. It has a 2.4 GHz Snapdragon, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal memory. It has 4 side speakers with Dolby DTS and sounds really good. The screen is an 11"" Full HD + which lacks a little verve and sharpness. That's where the price cut is noticeable. Not only in the 2000x1200 resolution but also in that it is not as sharp or vibrant as the Lenovo or Samsung. In other respects it performs quite well, internet browsing, movies, average games, doing most tasks quite quickly. At the price it is, I recommend it for simple tasks like I use it but yes, the 8GB of Ram.|",4,Redmi Pad SE

I managed to easily transfer my data from the iPhone to it with the help of the iPhone itself. The seller is very attentive and has received a lot of attention, the only point that can be negative is that we only see the product's own box inside a bag, or that it can cause some inconvenience not to move… the front camera is silent, or that I had not expected Because it is 5MP, the rear of 8MP is very satisfactory. But it is a common feature on tablets as cameras we should leave behind. Resolução da fabric e brilho achei bem bons. Or som really face jus years compliments clean and high.|",5,Redmi Pad SE
