Ryan S.|Ryan S.,8/10/2024,"Hello, this is my first review on Amazon. This review comes courtesy of a longtime Samsung user. Included is a picture of my S9 FE+ 256GB next to my second S6 Tab Lite (I lost the first one ;( ) shot on a S20 FE 5G. I will be comparing to my S6 Tab Lite. I really like the S6 Lite. I got it for $200 at Walmart (for both S6's). For comparison, I was given a Nexus 7 back in 2012, which was also purchased for $200. The Nexus is now 12 yo, and barely works. Using the S6 has been awesome. It's only chugged during intensive moments in gaming, and it only froze for a second or two. With three times the RAM as the S6, I don't think I'll have any problems for a long time.nThe size of the S6 Tab Lite is a lot more manageable for me. I could use it (the S6) one handed if I was only really using one half of the screen. I definitely can't with this! That being said, as somebody who's working on an engineering undergrad degree, I found the screen of the S6 too small. This screen feels big enough to use on most days. And with 256 GB instead of 64 GB, I can have games and lots of notes.A few notes: the S9 pen is a bit thicker and has a smaller button than the S6 pen. Second, I was getting better rear photos on the S6 than the S9, I don't know why. I hope it's user error. I'll update you on that. Finally, the S6 feels slimmer in my hand even though they're the same thickness, thanks to the S6 having rounded corners versus the sharper/more upright edges on the S9.Conclusion: For relaxation, the S6 is better, assuming you're not playing hard-core games (it ran fine on Honkai ... on the lowest settings). For work, the extra real estate pays dividends and with a good keyboard case, should be good to replace the laptop most of the time.Proper Review:When I wrote this originally, I didn't have the Samsung portfolio case. I left a review there about a month ago. (Short and sweet: It's very expensive, but it's also perfectly suited to what I need from this device. Backlighting would be nice, but I don't find it to be as much of an issue as I did a month ago.) Update on the camera: I think I smudged up the camera when grabbing the first time. I took a picture of an outdoor scene, and although it wasn't sharp, it wasn't really fuzzy either. I haven't done a side-by-side comparrison with the S6 Lite though. I'll update this update if I determine that smudges weren't the cause of the picture quality deficit.I learned about more software features, like RAM+ and wireless mirroring. In options, it gives the ability for up to 8 GB of virtual RAM. However, I also noted that 4 GB of RAM+ was selected and turned on by default. When I turned it off, it still showed up as 12 GB. Hopefully, this means I can have 20 GB of RAM, although I can't possibly imagine I'd need that many. I've noticed that the tablet seems to use at minimum around 4-5 GB of RAM. Makes me wonder how the S6 Lite manages to run Honkai Star Rail. I've seemed to have more performance issues in games than the S6 on higher settings, but the battery life is much better. It feels like this will never die! The S6 could only do 3-4 hours of gaming, but this can do much more, I think atleast twice as much, maybe triple? This also has faster charging speeds. Let me demonstrate the battery life. I have 1hr 15 minute classes. With note-taking almost the entire time, this went down 7%. At that rate, that's probably almost 16 hours of on-screen time!This tablet really is something special, especially with the portfolio case. It's small enough that I feel comfortable walking a mile to class with this in my hands (in a 13' Macbook case lol), and it's big enough that I can get work done on it - as long as I'm not constantly switching tabs. Windows is better for rearranging tabs, although Samsung provides more freedom - I just don't find that freedom useful personally. I still stand by my opinion that gaming is easier on the smaller screen - I accidentally pressed the accelerator in RR3 numerous times on the S9 FE+, but that never happened on the S6 Lite.Anyways, that's it for me. I'd highly recommend getting the extra RAM, especially if you're like me who was raised to use stuff until it falls apart. If you're a student, I couldn't recommend this tablet more strongly.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
4 Lil Lambs,11/1/2024,"I absolutely love this brand's tablets. This is my second one. But probably the fourth tablet for my family to purchase. First one lasted almost three and a half years before I had trouble with it. Then another five before it gave up the ghost.I love the upgrade of the pen. This was my one big reason with go with another samsung over say a fire. And I was thrilled with how well this tablet handled my artwork.Since getting I've been on it a lot. I love the bigger screen (In comparison to my phone) The high speed under which it works.If I could change or improve this, I don't think I would. The pen was my main complaint in the past, but I am thrilled on how they included, and upgraded it and how smoothly it works.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Stephen the Ex-Monk,12/20/2024,"Like any mobile device from Samsung, this tablet is well built and will last a few years if not abused.I'm not over fond of the Samsung special apps loaded and I tend to squash any I can. This is one reason I wish I could get a Pixel tablet with the same features, I do not like bloat.Aside from the unneeded software, it's pleasing to use. Some things are different from my old Tab S-3, but it's quite a few years newer so that's expected.Of note, the included S-pen will magnetically attach to the back of your tablet. This is a nice feature but also I don't trust it to keep my pen in place. I purchased a case which takes advantage of the magnet but uses an elastic strap to ensure it stays where its supposed to be.The fingerprint reader is on the power button and I've found it both natural to use and accurate. You can adjust the navigation controls to be either a three button configuration or a gesture type. I prefer the three button. Unlike the S3, these buttons are not a part of the physical devie and instead are onscreen. This gives you the ability to both change the position of the buttons (mine are right of center) you can also change the order so the back button is on the left like most other Android devices. Oddly, I am so used to having my tablet with back button on the right instead of left that I just left it there.When I activated the mobile connection, Verizon downloaded an e-sim to it instead of using the included nano-sim. It also didn't activate immediately and I don't know why. Eventually I successfully activated it and conclude the range is just as good as my phone. I'm not 100% sure buying with the 5G mobile connection was wise, but that's a personal decision.Outside of the question of whether getting 5G was a good idea, there's no question this is a good product and worth buying.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Farren Farret,12/8/2024,If you are debating getting this tablet i suggest you dong and just get it! the battery life is so good it last up to two days. I use my tablet for college and for illustrations and it works like heaven. On top of this the features are so cool like veing able to use it as a computer or being able to use it as a second monitor. This feature definetly has been helpful as i work on my laptop and need noted open on the side. it’s also decently customizable bc you can change the pen cursor as you’d like. This definetly more worth it than an Ipad in comparison because you’re not spending another $100 for a pen.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
3N?°,7/23/2024,"I bought this to make art and as soon as I touched the top of the S Pen to the screen I was blown away by how smooth and soft the feel is against the screen. Set up was quick and easy. It's even easier if you already have Google and Samsung accounts.It doesn't come with a charger block, only a type c to type c wire, which left me with no choice but to use a random off brand type c charger with a Samsung type A block which I hope won't mess with the battery or life span of this thing.The metallic lavender color is gorgeous and warm, quite similar to the pink HP Stream 14. The S Pen is a pastel, chalky lavender in a cooler tone.This tablet is razor thin, relatively lightweight for its size (perfect for drawing) and has a fantastic display.The user interface is typical of samsungs and androids. Unfortunately, Samsung phone themes are not compatible but you can customize the icons by selecting color schemes that match your wallpaper.Sounds quality is pretty good. It doesn't get too loud. To start, I played a mobile game and watched YouTube. Both experiences were hiccup-free and great on such a large, clear screen.The tablet comes with PENUP already on it, so artists who are just getting back into digital drawing will enjoy the app and its new, intuitive user interface.The S-pen has handwrite to text features that kick in automatically upon pairing with either your tablet or Samsung phone. I tried this S pen with both and the features come built into the pen!",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Mike Richart,12/10/2024,"Buying a new tablet is always hard. So many compromises to make since price is always an issue. I'm glad I picked the Tab 9 fe.Great color and faster than my older Tab.  This is my 4th Galaxy tablet, so I'm pretty comfortable in the Samsung universe. Even so, it takes a minute to learn the new features.Transferring from my old device was easy. Samsung walks you right through it.  A really Big Plus for me is the ability to mount a micro SD card. I added 256 gig. Gives me room.Charging is fast. Samsung doesn't include a wall wart, but I guess we all have a bunch. USB-C cable is Included.The S-Pen is new to me. The pen included is the 'dumb version so some advancedfeatures are not available.  An upgrade is available for purchase, if you want it.I'm not a Power User and this tablet is great for me.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Amazon Customer,11/9/2024,"I absolutely enjoy my new tablet. Price was high, this said, prior to this one i got the Doogee, and had to immediately returned it back to amazon. So i went for the brand i know is reputable. And I did. It was so easy to set up. The style can do everything: draw, notation, and even highlight. Perfect for what i need it for.  The sound from the speaker are clear, love the wide screen. the images as sharp  love the graphics. I still have to learn how to use some of the apps i downloaded like the song book for my guitar. Now I take my guitar lessons on the road with me or any trips i have and never miss out on reading, or my guitar lessons. I also play games and movies. Perfect tablet for my needs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Mar,1/19/2025,"If you install a photoshop for tablets, you'll get the most with images. Excellent tablet; however, if it is considered to design, try a bigger one to find it more confortable. The camera should be improved, however it's functionality is not to be used as camera. I strongly recommend it. Battery, translation, note taking, audio, video.. all excellent.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Kat W,1/6/2025,"My old Samsung tablet stopped receiving updates in 2019, so I figured it was time for a new one. After so much looking and comparing many brands and sizes, I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2023 in silver.Some of the layout and apps look similar to my old tablet, but many things have improved. The tablet seems fast, and charges fast (I purchased a fast Samsung charger separately). I like the fingerprint-scanning button (when the tablet is not locked). The S pen is responsive, even with a glass screen protector installed. I'm not into taking a lot of pictures, so the camera is fine for me. The sound is fine for me as well. since I just need the basics, nothing fancy, and I'm not a gamer.I got rid of some preinstalled apps, some that I was able to remove; others that I couldn't remove I disabled. I added some of my own apps, and added some music on an SD card. I like the note-taking app that was preinstalled.The Tab S9 is the right size for me to use as an e-book reader. I have a case with a hand strap, so I usually hold my tablet to read or check email. There are many things that can be customized on this tablet, including accessibility features. I'm liking this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
KralosJr|KralosJr,12/23/2024,"I just bought it on black Friday and I couldn't be happier about the purchase, the tablet feels very good, good quality, the Dex help mode is very useful, especially for people who need to have several apps open at once, the excellent multitasking. I haven't tried the battery as much but so far it's according to my needs, I have the 65W Samsung charger and I charge the tablet in 1h 30m, so I have no battery issues.Working with the S Pen is very comfortable, writing with it along, with palm rejection is very useful.I haven't tried it as much in games but having a common use have been very fluid the experience, The processor isn't high-end but so far I've done well in the games I've tried.What I like most is its integration with the Samsung ecosystem, I have an S22+ and passing files between devices is very easy, even to PC through Samsung Flow, the connection is very fast.For the use that the one wanted, which was basically for the University, it is really useful to take notes and work on Word or PowerPoint, even more if you add an inhalable keyboard with trackpad. Plus, it's great for watching media, with a good screen and great speakers.Being able to expand your memory using an SD card is something that is strange about today's phones and allows you to expand storage in a very easy way.I am a loyal Samsung user and I have not been disappointed with this Galaxy Tab S9 FE, if you are thinking of buying it, I recommend it.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Kat in AZ,1/21/2025,"When I ordered this tablet, I was thinking it was pretty much the same size as most tablets my family owns and the one I was replacing, but it was a bit larger screen size. It is pretty close to the same weight as the one I was replacing, but has more memory and it works great. The stylus is so easy to use, and it attaches to the back of the tablet magnetically. I bought a case that has an open area for the stylus, with an elastic band to hold it securely, so I don't have to worry about losing the stylus, I am very pleased with this tablet overall.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Piwai|Piwai,1/12/2025,"The Galaxy S9 FE+ tablet is much bigger than I initially expected, but it’s absolutely stunning. The premium design, paired with how thin and lightweight it feels, makes it a joy to use. It’s worth every penny, offering exceptional performance and the ability to multitask seamlessly, thanks to its split-screen functionality.The S Pen is a standout feature—responsive, precise, and perfect for note-taking or creative tasks. The camera quality is impressive for a tablet, and the sound output is nothing short of fantastic, providing an immersive media experience. Overall, this tablet combines beauty, power, and versatility in one sleek package. Highly recommend it!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Akeeli,1/2/2025,"I just wanted a tablet for drawing with, the size is nice enough to where I can see everything and zoom in enough for the finer details.The pen is super responsive and ready to use right of the bat, no charging needed :)I did end up downloading a game or two on it just to see it’s performance and it wasn’t that good lolHonkai Star Rail, and Wuthering Waves are more demanding games than some, and while they do run, they’re crunchy !It runs Puzzle and Dragons, Clash of Clans, and Fire Emblem Heroes well enough at least— but yeah, I moreso got this tablet for drawing !",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Lyn Osborn,1/12/2025,"So far the notebook works fine.  It was in a very filmsy container that was torn open, so hoping I don't have problems down the road. The USPS shipping trail was almost laughable: It started it's journey near Cleveland, OH went to Detroit, MI, up toTraverse City ,MI, down to our town in northern IN to be delivered. BUT NO! Back up to Traverse City, then to Grand Rapids, then to Indianapolis to Fort Wayne, then finally back up to me in northern IN. I had a great time tracking this package. ??",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
LAZYMOODZ,1/7/2025,"I've had my tablet for about 2 months now. I use it for reading and light surfing. Battery life is great because I use every feature possible to save it,  i.e. Battery life saver on, dim display, dark mode, sleep mode, do not disturb mode etc. I can't say what it's like for a heavy user but if you want a ""small screen tablet"" for reading and simple tasks, this is a good choice.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
James S.|James S.,12/7/2024,"This purchase was for my wife for Christmas. She has previously owned two Samsung Tab As. This was a tremendous upgrade for her. She says that the operating system in almost identical to her S24 phone. My first complaint is that Samsung did not include a charging block with this device. Many of the charging blocks available on Amazon have less than stellar reviews. The buyer is left to their own devices to find the most appropriate charging block online or in a retail store. This is sad considering how many iterations of charging blocks manufacturers have gone through in the past 5 to 10 years. Another complaint is that the tab (and separately ordered accessories) arrived in a box with no cushioning material, literally clanging around but this is an Amazon problem and has nothing to do with the quality of the device.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Keith A. Smith,1/15/2025,"I have many Samsung products. TVs, phones, tablets and this s9 FE + makes the eleventh currently in use.With 12gb ram, great processor, and 256gb expandable hd, this is a bargain. Very pleased with the purchase.

Plumer Lovelace,1/12/2025,"The shipment of my Samsung tablet arrived quickly. The device arrived new, and in the manufacturer’s packaging with all of the proper accessories.

I would highly recommend this seller.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
S.D.,12/24/2024,"I used a Samsung S4 before upgrading to this one. I have had a great experience with all of my Samsung devices thus far so I was confident in buying this one. The S4 worked great for as long as I had it. The only reason I switched to this one is because I needed a bigger screen. So far, I'm loving it. The screen size is great. It is fast and has good battery life. I'm hoping to get at least as much use out of it as the previous one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Mountain Biker,12/13/2024,"So far I love this tablet.  The 12.4"" screen size and display clarity exceeded my expectations, and the processor speed is great too!  It was very easy to import all of my items from my old Samsung tablet, so I was up and running again in no time.  Also, the sound quality blew me away, especially considering that it's coming from a tablet.  I wish it came with a case, and it would be great if it had a USB port, but those shortcomings aren't enough to keep me from being very happy with my purchase.  I would highly recommend this tablet.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

Gregory L Young,12/14/2024,"Power, power and then some more power. I never want to have buyers remorse when purchasing electronic units such as a tablet or a laptop. I don't want to repurchase my electronics every couple years to keep up with the new power hungry software programs. This is the top rated tablet on the market. Do your research. I researched for over 12 hours for my next tablet. I will be years before I need to go through that again with this tablet. Con: it needs 4 speakers, rather than the two that it comes with. The it would be perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Natacha Brutus,1/3/2025,This is a great tablet at a great price. Not much else to say. I usually get electronics from stores that specialize in electronics but the protection plans ate so pricey so i went with Amazon this time ad it was delivered in perfect condition.,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

Not being top of the line at the time I got it was still perfect.

I'm not a great artist, but I feel like I can make and implement my embroidery designs much easier now.It was very easy to set up and start using.

Veronica Subia,10/24/2024,"I was down the rabbit hole on researching the best tablet or laptop for basic writing . Things that are important to me are storage, processing input, portability , durability, accessory compatibility, and  dual functionality. I've had the tablet for about 3 weeks now and I use it daily. I purchased a magnetic bluetooth keyboard for it and it has been a seemless match. The touch sensitivity is HIGH. I'm still learning how to get used to that. I'm able to have multiple screens open and split the screen to view them at once. This is incredibly important for me and what I bought the tablet for. The battery life is very nice as well. I only charge it every other day and I use it a few hours on a daily basis. Charging isn't the fastest but it holds the charge really well ! All in all, I'd say its a great purchase for simple use .",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

The tablet and smaller items were loose inside the outer packing box.I removed tablet from it's tight paper wrap to find the screen covered in fingerprints.Also, one tiny scratch on the back, about an inch long, otherwise it looks brand new.I suspect it was opened gently, fondled admiringly, then regret-returned, but who knows?It hardly seems worth returning for a new one, but Amazon, my friend, you get a 0/5 on this one.I can't give that kind of oversight a free pass, hence the review.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Josh,12/17/2024,Love it so far. No lag amd easy to write on. I prefer the smooth screen to the paper like screen covers.

Bruce E. Nagel,12/12/2024,I'm glad I ordered this. Samsung is a excellent brand. I haven't discovered how to reduce the screen sensitivity. It seems that anything lightly brushing across the screen produces unintentional results. Don't know if that is correctable. I also don't care for the shutting down process. Very hard for me to accomplish in the dark. Overall though I highly recommend this product.,4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

John Galt 2021,10/16/2023,"Updates will be posted on the top.Update #3 12/07/23My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0  Quick download and install no problems.Update #2 10/30/23I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow.  One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the ""strict power saving"" mode.  i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app.  So, I changed the power saving mode to ""optimizzed' and everything worked fine.Update #1 - 10/19/23.I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger.  It took 50 minutes.  The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.It came a day early.  The packaging was excellent.I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8.  I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9"" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger.  The battery was at 51%.  I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick.  I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8.  The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying.  it went pretty quick.All the apps except two copied.  One for some reason is not compatible with the S9.  The other I was able to install from Google Play.  After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps.  The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8.  At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem.  The extra .4"" in the display over the A8 is nice.  The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.I haven't tried any games since I don't play them.  I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.As far as the OS goes.  It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1.  However, the Android security update was Aug 1st.  I imagine it will update soon enough.  Google Play was June 2023.  It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.That is it for now.  I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.Another excellent product from Samsung.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus

MISS PRINGLE,8/24/2024,"For a long time, I was strongly considering purchasing a new laptop computer.  I looked at and pondered over the many choices before finally deciding on choosing a new tablet.  I'm so glad I made that decision!The thing I love most about this tablet is its size!  It's about the same size as a small laptop, but with all the advantages of the Android platform.  I love Android!This tablet is fast, and there is a ton of storage space.  The only negative I have found is the same as on my previous Samsung tablet:  Some keys on the keyboard are ""wonky"" (for lack of a better word).  By this I mean, that when typing on the touchscreen, there are times when the key pressed results in a different letter, or even a number.  The ""T,"" for example, will often result in the number ""5,"" right above it.  I'm sure this is my fault somehow,  but it's irritating, nonetheless.Other than that small, occasional issue, I find this tablet to be a cut above my previous Samsung tablet, which had served me well, also.  But, it was time for an upgrade!",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Kihan Kim,12/20/2024,The big screen make the wonderful view,5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Diana Cornwell,10/30/2024,"I’m making this review on the S9 tablet even though it was returned.  The tablet works great, the visuals are nice. The reason for the return is that it was too large and cumbersome for the individual who was going to use it.  He needed a smaller tablet to use.  This definitely is a good tablet.  I gave it four stars only because it was too large.  Otherwise it is worth 5 stars.",4,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
TRCIII,10/2/2024,"When my previous Galaxy tablet with S Pen began failing, I found out they no longer made that size tablet, with the minimum now being 10.9"", and I wasn't sure I was going to like it.I don't.  I LOVE IT!  Crisp display, smarter ""Smart Switch"" and built-in technology to lead you through initial setup than I remember from previous upgrades, made the changeover completely painless. Took a 1 TB memory card without issue.  Sound is better than you'd expect from a tablet this size, certainly superior to my old model.  S Pen feels sturdier (especially the pen tip) than others I've had.All in all, a great addition to the Galaxy family of Tablets with S Pen.A few weeks later:Love my Tab more than ever, every day I use it. Someone asked a question (which I was unable to answer or find again) about OTG adapter use. I put in an adapter and added on a 2 TB external SSD with no issues, was able to effect file transfers, play music off the external drive, with no issues. If you need more than the 1 TB that you can add as internal storage, no worries, theres's always a way to access more storage.",5,Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus
Larry M. Bergelt,11/16/2024,"I am so glad I went ahead and bought this tablet. My last tablet was a Samsung from Verizon. Unfortunately, it and its case have seen better days.

Joe L|Joe L,7/29/2024,"This tablet is more than enough for my needs.The speed, graphics, crisp and vibrant screen, all make for a wonderful experience. I was originally looking into the ultra, but I couldn't justify the purchase when the only real differences are screen, speaker and ram related, and nothing i'll do with it will really max out the current specs. The speakers sound amazing on this thing. Most tablets just have cheap tinny speakers just to fill the spaces while the Galaxy S line seems to have had a lot of thought put into sound quality. The camera is quite decent as well. Not top of the line, but for a tablet, it takes some pretty clear photos.It charges quite fast as well, and stays charged for a while, even with heavy game play, just like my S23 U. I did about 3 hours of straight play on war universe and it was still around 80% when I shut it down.I did make sure to get an illuminated magnetic keyboard case, and a high speed 512gb Samsung Micro SD card for it. Don't need them, just wanted to get them and got a good deal. The next thing I get will be a bluetooth mouse to complete the laptop feel. lolThis is the best tablet for the money in my eyes.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Anonymous Geek,10/16/2024,"Bought this tablet to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 which wasn't able to be updated any more. The S9 is noticeably faster and the video quality is excellent, seemingly even better than the S6. I use VLC software to play videos and the new tablet shows no lag and no drops/stalls. Transferring my data from the S6 was done using SmartSwitch (highly recommended) and the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with the S9. This was really very fast. Loading new videos to the S9 from my PC was also fast, much faster than for the S6. No issues at all. Highly recommended.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Julian,8/23/2024,"Originally, I bought this Tablet with the intent to use it for gaming. Ultimately, I found that there is so much more you can get out of it than that.Its a very thin, lightweight tablet. The screen is an impressive size that felt larger in my hands than I had expected. I was originally considering going for the Ultra, but the size of the S9+ is more than enough for what I need. I actually feel more comfortable using this tablet without the protective case that I purchased for it when at home. I didn't even bother putting on the protective glass screen I bought for it because I don't see myself abusing this tablet as hard as I abuse my phone.The performance is fantastic. This has no problem playing whatever games you might want to play on it and the refresh rate is superb. As someone who regularly uses a high refresh rate monitor, I can appreciate seeing similar performance on a tablet.What I wasn't expecting when I bought this was how much I could get out of Samsung's Second Screen app. This built in application allows you to wirelessly connect your Samsung tablet to your PC and use it as an additional monitor. As someone who regularly uses a laptop for work, its a game changing asset to have. The integration is seamless; you can even choose to enable the touchscreen so that you could browse through documents like you would with a kindle without having to go through the hassle of doing file transfers.However with performance comes a price. It goes without saying that these tablets are pretty damn expensive. If I had to make a recommendation, I would suggest settling for the S9 which my friend bought and is more than satisfied with. Most of what you are getting out of making the jump to the S9+ or Ultra is a larger screen size. Visit your local electronics store and see which one is right for you.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Dnl,9/6/2024,"In today's tech market, all products are expensive.  The Samsung Tab S9 is an amazing device and out performs all other tablets, imo. I prefer it over the giant iPad I have, and this is the 3rd Samsung Tab I have owned.Setup was simple. Just connect with my phone (S23) and done.Classic black body, tons of memory and storage.

For a Dex experience, a portable keypad for example, Dexnor or similar is recommended.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
PhillyGirl,2/11/2024,"My previous Samsung Note tablet circa 2014 is very old. Not wanting to purchase a new tablet I reformatted it hopefully to bring it back to life. But its old and not useful for todays apps. About a year or more has passed before looking again at the tablet world.  I rocked a Samsung not 8 phone well past its use and recently upgraded to a S23. I absolutely love the S-pen and S-Note. My new tablet had to be pen capable. Just using a pen is way different than pen features baked into the ecosystem of the device.Enter the S9 tablet family. I played around with the idea of getting by with one from the S8 family because of expense, but I like bells and whistles. I also intend to have this tablet for many years, so OS updating is important.I picked the Samsung S9 plus. Amazon was offering it with 512gb with 13 percent off which was 30 bucks cheaper than the 256gb version. I've played the available built in storage game before.  I'll be using this tablet for a variety of functions so having the larger  space for apps and all of my projects will be nice.Test...First I charge to full capacity before turning it onI then used Samsung's transfer tool and copied my apps from my S23 to the S9 plus tablet. This worked without a hitch.Let those apps updateUpdate the OS under settingsPlay time....Audio-I read that the sound of this tablet was superb so I head to play something from my Amazon collection before heading to YouTube to play some videos. It has rich bass and volume.Video-I played a video from my digital library, Amazon, YouTube and Vudu. Colors were nice and bright so no surprises thereS-pen-Although they were creative with the magnetic back storage, I wished it was like the phone and my old tablet with the S-pen stored inside. The pen itself is pleasantly thicker than anticipated. Samsung made a good move in matching the color of both the pen and tablet. There's a lot of features to learn if you care to. The included S-notes is a beast of a program, but you can also use other programs like OneNote.The only thing with the form of this tablet is it is long horizontally. So when holding that way it seems a bit long. I rather like the more square shape of my old tablet. There's a lot to learn about the features and youtube is a great tutor. Even just now typing this out one came to me with holding down the Ctrl key. It lights up the letters y, a, z, x, c and v which are shortcuts for specific functions. Very cool!When you get it, pay attention to the return policy and use it to death within that time frame. This is already long so I may update only if I come across an issue that impacts negatively.It is pricey, but it is a premium feature tablet. You can get cheaper with going with lesser specs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Sam,12/30/2024,"Love this tablet, it runs fast and switches smoothly from app to app. The landscape mode is the only thing I don't really like, it will only turn one direction to watch in landscape which is not convenient. I would check to see when the newest one will be released before spending over 1K on a tablet though. You could end up with an older tablet when the newest is coming out in a month or so.Battery life is great, I use it every day & listen to it all night every night. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to transport or travel with. Easily pairs with any Bluetooth keyboard and any other BT devices.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+

Charlotte Emily,10/26/2024,"i got sucked down the rabbit hole of digital planners and stuff from YouTube shorts, and between that and wanting to learn how to digital draw at some point, i ended up getting this on Prime Day for $750 ($794 after tax i think). I 1000% recommend getting it for that price vs the $900+ as that's so much for a previous series with the 10s out now.for that price, it's amazing. i plan to try to keep it going until 2030 just like the new PC i got in June, and if i get that much use out of it, i'll be so happy.dex mode is underrated, and all my stuff BT-connects without issuesyou can also music share with a samsung phone so they can both use the same headphones/earbuds.my friend even made a comment about how he thought it was very nice as someone who's never really gone after serious tablets before. so i take that as a win as well lol",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

ShareBear,8/21/2024,"** 3 Month update ***I’ve set up a reliable Dex ecosystem for my Samsung tablet, Caldigit TS4 to expand the number of ports available, wired mouse and keyboard, and a monitor (HP Omen). With this setup I can run Dex flawlessly (Dex is a built in desktop operating system that comes with Samsung smart phones and tablets)My primary uses for this device are Google workspace (you have to use the chrome browser for all features, the apps are functional, but lack a lot of editing features), web based management systems, and media.The stock speakers are great (comparable to laptop speakers, a little tinny, but generally sound great for the device class)The screen is gorgeous, and as a stand alone tablet you can absolutely use Dex with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard on the fly, managing a couple windows side by side feels comfortable (not too small)Could this replace your laptop? So long as you don’t rely on specific software. Absolutely, this would be great for student or business owners on the go. Not too big to bring with you, but not too small to be unusable.This thing has exceeded my expectation for sure. Same internals as the ultra tab, smaller screen.Perfect for excel, google sheets, word processing, and when paired with mouse and keyboard is effectively functional as an ultra portable laptop.If most of your work is web based or general word processing 10/10 I’d recommend.Haven’t had any issues with lagging, overheating, or battery health.I do recommend adjusting your battery settings to prevent it from charging past 80%, and while it is convenient disabling fast charging will help preserve the battery life in the long run.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
S. Reyes,10/4/2024,"First off this tablet is great! My recommendation is to price around once a week and see the various colors they offer. It changes! When I bought this one, the beige was cheaper than the black. Then the following week when my husband wanted one. Both of them where at the same price and a few cents more expensive then what I bought mine.I got this tablet to replace my laptop. Don't get me wrong I would rather be on my laptop but due to a wrist injury I can't lift much without help or being in pain. So this is why I got it.I'm a samsung user in general so the setup was easy for me. Everyone's learning curve is different. Wifi is good but the downside it will try to connect to everything! Even the neighbors stuff! Changing and keeping the charge is fine but it drains quickly if I'm watching youtube or playing a moblie game like Honkai: Star Rail. I think I can get 4 hours of Honkai without and be at 10%.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Vakmere,8/17/2024,"Pro: Great screen and sharpness. Very fast going to any screen, browser, menu scrolling, easy to learn more about all its functions by going on YouTube. I got the 512G memory so plenty of space there. Got a nice case for it. Easy-to-use keyboard is also a plus. Synch easily to my Samsung phone as the Quick Share makes short work of transferring data and apps to this tablet. There's more positives however the fun is exploring it. Bluetooth finds your printers easily and is very useful.  Games are handled very well. Syncs to any other Samsung appliance, TV, and others. Screen protector is something you'll need to decide on. S-Pen is very useful, a learning curve is needed buy easily learned.Con: I don't like Google Sheets or Docs. Very annoying to use especially if you are used to Microsoft Works. To use MS Excel or Word here a subscription is need. Using Google Sheets and docs takes a few YouTube video searches. Can be very confusing trying to find files.No SD slot. No earphones jack. No 5G unless you specifically get one with it. Useless outdoors away from a WIFI signal. Battery does drain a little faster than I'd like and fast charging isn't really that fast.Summary: You'll like this tablet. Screen size is just right and updated regularly the functionality is very high. Screen is very reactive with touch and quick. You'll like it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+

Alana Duncan,9/17/2023,"Tablets and I typically don't get along, especially on the Android side of things, which is why my enthusiasm for this tablet has really caught me by surprise. I've owned a few Android tablets, an iPad Mini, and a little Surface tablet -- and mostly these experiences taught me that, just maybe, tablets aren't for me. I always missed having a cursor, or having a keyboard that wasn't a case, or, most of all, programs on my desktop (or even just my Chromebook). So I kind of turned my back on tablets for a while. I was using my two-in-one Samsung Chromebook 2 as a tablet, but the myriad of issues that have recently cropped up on that device made me want to try an actual tablet again.Enter the S9. I've loved this thing from the moment I unboxed it. Calling the color 'beige' almost seems like an insult; it's a nice, silvery white that really makes the device stand out, and the matching color of the S Pen is a nice touch. And the screen is absolutely gorgeous, I can't stop admiring it whenever I wake it up. The colors and brightness are really great, and you can fine tune the latter for your needs. I haven't tried using it in a full blast of sunlight, yet, but it's excelled everywhere else. Portability is a breeze since the S9 is so light. Even with the case I have for it, which adds a bit of heft, it's still much easier to carry around than my Chromebook. And the functionality! I have the Samsung Flip 5 and the Samsung Buds Live, and the S9 interfaces with both of them flawlessly. I can look at messages from my phone (and it also grabbed a bunch of info from it, saving me time) and listen to both my tablet and my phone on my Buds Live, among other things. Gone are the days that I need to pack a separate headset/earphones for my tablet and my phone. It's such a stream-lined setup, I love it.This is ordinarily where I would list all of my cons, but I don't have a lot, honestly. My only dissatisfaction is how expensive the S9's Samsung accessories are (how much for the covers? oof!), and how limited, but maybe more will spring up in time. I used to dislike how limited apps were on Android tablets, but now you can get a huge plethora of apps that connect to your destktop versions. It really just depends on what you use and how you work.So, yeah. I love this thing, as you can tell. I've written this review on it, even. If you need a tablet spruce-up in your life, and you own some other Samsung products, I recommend this one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
lawyer in Pittsburgh,7/17/2024,"I mainly bought this my first tablet device to take notes on in a way that would store my notes in an easily accessible place and be available to me across devices (on my phone and PC as well). I am having trouble getting my notes from OneNote to synch to the cloud so that my other devices can see them. That is more of a software issue. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 NotePaper Screen Panel to improve the writing experience for note taking, which was an improvement. I did not love the writing experience on the bare screen. Too slippery, and too much unintentional palm interaction with screen. I also bought a Dexnor keyboard case for it, which works pretty well, but it is not a great typing experience. Just useful in a pinch. It has good battery life and seems to have good processor speed. All in all I am not sure this was a wise investment to try to transition to digital note taking, away from paper. It remains to be seen if I stick with it or switch back to paper. I have to get the synching working to stick with it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+

Doc Jim,9/10/2024,"Finally! A tablet that delivers performance like I have never seen before in an android tablet. Fast screen refresh time and very responsive GPU and CPU. I did have a problem using the smartswitch app. While trying to use smartswitch to copy my phone contents into the tablet, the app wanted to update but was unable to. I allowed the tablet to complete its installation and initialization and when it was done, I updated the smartswitch app then tried again this time with glowing success.I have some concerns with the expected lifetime of this tablets amoled screen but I have read that Samsung has taken steps to prevent burnin and other screen problems.If you want solid performance in an android tablet then this is the one to get. I would not recommend giving this level of tablet to a child.I wold have also purchased the book case keyboard with it had it been available,",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Vincent Van Gopher,8/21/2024,"This tablet is so fast and has a great screen and surprisingly good sound for something so thin.  A relative actually had to ask me to turn it down when I was playing a news broadcast in the next room while they were on the phone.  I wish my Chromebook sounded this good. The fingerprint sensor is super fast and reliable. It also holds a charge really well.  It doesn't run down quickly when in heavy use, and when I just leave it on for a couple days without using it much, it's still above 90 percent on Day 3.IMHO the Android system is much more user-friendly than Apple's, and I have a Samsung phone, so it was especially quick and easy to set it up with the apps I like to use -- it all transferred over by logging in, basically.  I still have to learn all the features, like using Dex, pop-up screens, and the stylus.I do like the form factor of the iPad slightly better -- prefer the more rounded edges. Otherwise, this is pretty much perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

Native American Spirit,9/23/2024,"I chose the smallest of this Samsung line. it's a little bigger than most tablets, but is a perfect for,  well, most everything! I'm so pleased with my choice! the snapdragon processor is fast and smooth, the new screen glass provides extra protection,  for me,that's a great thing,  wifi is awesome fast and no problems. love the on screen touch buttons and you barely have to tap the screen for responding,  nice and sensitive! this size is very portable! this tablet can do so much more, it's like a mini laptop. Excellent blacks and the 4k is mind blowing,  you can't go wrong with Samsung! When I bought mine it was a little pricy, but it will last for many years to come and won't outdated. we have a new Samsung oled 65"" tv and this tablet is compatible with it and all other Samsung products.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

danny,1/1/2025,Got for Christmas to replace my other samsung tablet. It works great and is faster than my last tablet. My only problem is that they have so many different options and it is hard to get the best one. You just don't know what options are the best for your money or your just getting ripped off buy paying for something that is the same as the another one that is cheaper. Samsung changes just one word and then charges even more money for something that is the same.,3,Galaxy Tab S9+
Biggles,5/18/2024,"When I first started setup, I had a major issue with this product. It damped what should have been an exciting time. The tablet is definitely a superstar, but I had an issue getting the Samsung keyboard to show up. This is my 4th Samsung tablet, so it's not like I'm some newbie. I won't drag this out, but it took an online video for me to find the missing component. After that, the magic began. This is the reason that I'm giving the tablet, a definite 5 star, a 4 star rating. It shouldn't take online videos to get the startup successfully completed. I'll still buy Samsung products and still love them, but I wish this could have gone more smoothly. I definitely recommend this tablet and hope your purchase goes smoothly. ETA:  this is a rewrite of my original posting as I always want to be as fair as possible in my reviews.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
pancho,8/14/2023,"So far, the Tablet has been amazing. This is the first time I own a tablet, so I was really satisfied with the size of the S9. To be honest, I was going to buy the S9 Ultra until I realized that I just wanted it for reading and perhaps basic gaming (i.e. Dead cells, gacha games, etc.). I was worried about the S9 since I did not know what to expect for 11', but it has been great and works well. If you are planning to use the tablet as a book, video watcher, and basic gaming, I believe the S9 will suffice. Since I already have a great laptop, I realized that a bigger size was useless for me. So, the size for a consumer that is planning to use it for basic functions will be happy to know that the S9 is more than enough.I like the design of this Tablet; it looks super nice, and the included pen helps a lot when maneuvering around the screen. Actually, I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, which is old, but it came with a pen as well, but I never used it; however, with the table, I believe it is critical since it is too big for me to reach the top of the screen (And this is an 11', I cannot imagine how hard would have been if I had a bigger one).The only bad thing I can think of is not with the Table itself but with this listing, they tell you it will come with a ""FREE"" book cover, but I didn't receive it. Amazon was nice enough to give me a partial refund, but now I have no cover T_T. So yeah, don't expect a free book cover. Actually, this is why I lowered the rating since the product itself is fantastic. Nonetheless, the retailer failed to provide me with what they promised. Even when I went to their website, they didn't help at all! It was annoying since they will be like go here, go there to end up not getting anything and wasting time.TL;DR: The tablet is great, comes with a nice pen, and is beautifully designed. However, they didn't give me a book cover. Nonetheless, Amazon helped me by giving me a partial refund.",4,Galaxy Tab S9+
Mary H.,7/29/2024,"I moved up from a 5 year old 10"" Samsung Galaxy tablet to this one and have not been disappointed. It has great color and fast processing. There are a lot of features new to this one that I still am learning to use. The S Pen is convenient and the camera takes excellent pictures. The screen is big enough and has great clarity so I can put it on my lap and watch movies in bed. The only drawbacks are the weight (it's heavy) and the battery life which I don't think is as great as Samsung promotes it to be. I did buy a protective cover for it which of course increased the weight. I bought it on sale on an Amazon Prime day so overall I'm happy with this purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
David C. Harris,5/18/2024,"I had never been an Android tablet user and I received a Samsung A7 Lite from T-Mobile supposedly for free, but it was not free. The A7 Lite was very under powered and could not keep up with program/app demands. I had been very pleased that I could put apps on the tablet that I really did not want on my phone. I used the Fit-Bit app as well as the Toyota app quite often, but they were slow. After about 2 years and a number of app & OS updates, the Fit-Bit and Toyota apps were almost worthless; the Toyota app was taking days to update my car's charging history, and the Fit-Bit app took 3 or 4 synchronizations, and still might not be accurate; I thought the problems were with the service and not my A7 tablet. I took a chance on this S9 because it had more memory and a more powerful processor, and boy, I could not be happier. My Toyota charging history has been up to date within hours, and the Fit-Bit data is a one-and-done when synchronizing.  My old A7 would not stream my video from my Synology NSA, but the S9 has no problem. I am very, very happy with my S9 purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Verified Customer,9/16/2024,"Its a Samsung so you know it is a great quality tablet. Super fast and holds a charge for a long time. Screen makes images look great. I did reject the order because it was supposed to be overnight and I needed it. I went to Best Buy and bought it there. Amazon is getting bad on actually getting you the order overnight.  I had to wait 3 days to cancel the order because it sat in some warehouse.  Then it took 10 days for them to credit my card. An item that cost $1000 and is never delivered, should be refunded right away.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
AmazonCustomer,2/4/2024,"I've always bought the cheaper Samsung A series Android tablets and they've always disappointed in the long run. The S9 is just so responsive and quick at everything it does that I think it's worth the higher price. The OLED screen is excellent overall and it's just a joy to use.I tried to go the iPad route to see what all the hype was about and bought the base model 9th gen about a year ago. It was a pretty good tablet with a nice screen and decent speed, but the Apple ecosystem just wasn't for me. The S9 is better at everything and doesn't have big black bars on the sides of your videos due to Apple's unique display ratio. The 120Hz screen on the S9 is amazing. It made my iPad feel terrible to use when I went back to it for a comparison.I think most of all I missed the Google discover news feed (swipe left when on home screen). Apple news is a paid thing for most of the content and I found myself using my android phone to get my my news feed vs. my Apple tablet. The Google news app on iPad just wasn't the same. One thing I really did like about the iPad was the gestures. Turns out that android has pretty much identical gestures in the display options  and it's the best of both worlds for me on the s9 now. Don't think I'll have to upgrade for quite a while with how powerful this S9 is!",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
MD,9/6/2023,"I bought this to replace a similar Galaxy Tab S4.  Nothing wrong with the older tablet, just was ready to upgrade- five years of use and not a single problem with it!  Anyway, there is almost no question the Tab S is the best Android tablet. The LED screens are just fantastic.  This new model is even faster yet.  0.5"" bigger screen (11"" instead of 10.5"") and almost the same size and weight.I got in on the deal that increased the memory and doubled the storage for no extra charge, so an astounding 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage- both way more than I will ever need.  S-pen works very well.  Sound is great (for a tablet).  Love the new in-screen fingerprint sensor.  Micro SD card slot works perfectly.The only thing I hate is that there is no headphone jack.  Almost didn't buy it for that reason, alone.  I hate using adapters/dongles.  And to use a dongle means I have to pry out the magnetic USB charger connector I love, every time, which is very difficult to do and I will likely lose it because it is so small.  There is ZERO reason to not include a headphone jack.  There is plenty of space, and they make jacks that are just as water-resistant as the USB port.  OK, I will stop with that rant.Oh, the price is crazy too.  Most people simply will not spend this much on a tablet, opting for something like the ""A"" line instead.  This model was $200 MORE than the crazy high price of my old S4, but the screen on the ""S"" is just so nice, so I just gotta have it :)",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

Kathy,6/27/2024,"This is my 3rd Samsung Galaxy S series tablet. I upgraded from my S6 to this one.  While the cost is more than I'd like to spend, the quality is great. The pictures are crisp and the speakers are great. The S pen that comes with it is a great feature and I'm glad it comes with the tablet and isn't an add on accessory. I got the base model which is similarly sized to my S6 because it was what I could afford.  I'd like to get the bigger model (plus or ultra) but they are just cost prohibitive.  The S series still has an expandable micro SD card slot, which I use.  I'm a die hard android user, so after months of consideration, finally caved.  Gave my daughter the S6 and now we are both happy.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

I wanted something portable that I could use as a computer to access my files online, work with my photos in Lightroom, and take notes or draw. I ultimately decided to go with the Tab S9 because of Samsung's strong reputation in electronics, their integration with Windows, and the DEX feature.I'm not disappointed, as the Tab S9 meets all my expectations. I’ve started bringing it to work for productivity and note-taking is fun now that my handwriting can be converted to text. However, Android software is not Windows, and trying to replicate my PC experience on the tablet has encountered some roadblocks. Fortunately, there is always a workaround.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+
Steve T,4/3/2024,"This replaced my Samsung Tab S2 (a 2016 purchase).  The best part is the rich audio, absolutely stunning (and louder than the S2 I had been using).  Thankfully my phone charger also charges this tablet, the chargers are no longer included in the box.  There is no instruction booklet either, but you can view it on the phone or download it from the Samsung web site.  The Pen is a new toy for me, and it will be a while before I learn all it can do.  The product I purchased connects by means of WiFi 6 which is fast, my old Tab was WiFi or an added component on my wireless service of my phone carrier - I found that WiFi use only is totally sufficient in our world today compared to 2016.  If I get half as many years as my Tab S2 then the cost is well worth it - though I tend to stretch use out as long as I can.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

S. McCallister,3/30/2024,"This is my third Samsung Android tablet, with my previous one being the Galaxy Tab 7.  This is obviously newer, but it's also larger, nearly as large a screen as a 13"" laptop.  The screen and build quality are wonderful... and the extra real estate allows for even more immersive movies and gaming.  But bigger also means more bulky and heavy to travel with, especially if you also need to be carrying a laptop.  My wife uses her tablet as her primary device, and she loves this tablet.  I appreciate it, but when I go for a long trip later this year it will be interesting to see how I feel about its bulk.  Again, no technical complaints about this device, but I do think you need to consider how it will fit into your life and travels.  For someone who primaryily uses thi in one or two place, I'd have no reservations recommending it, just to be clear.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

I  The screen and lightweight are the two things that blew me away at first.  It was very easy to sync absolutely everything with my new S24 Ultra.  I'm looking forward to getting the tempered glass screen protector and magnetic Dexnor Case with built  in keyboard/S Pen holder tomorrow (as well as the new Watch6).

I actually had to reduce the brightness setting by a hefty amount to be comfortable for my eyes, and the built in speakers are sufficient that you really don't need to pair them to an external sound system to enjoy listening to music.If it continues to operate this well over time I will be a Samsung Galaxy tablet customer for life.You've got a great product here Samsung, don't mess it up by ""fixing"" it until it's broke.",5,Galaxy Tab S9+

Takes away from the killer design and look, but better safe than sorry.Battery life seems to be solid assuming I'm not running live nest.ring cams in the background, otherwise you'll kill the battery in about 5-7 hours.

The assisting experience is excellent, the fabric is very good and the audio is also due to four night outings. Buy it to help our studies and do not be disappointed, it meets all your needs. This is two days without charging and now that the battery is at 54%, it charges relatively quickly, the charger is turbo more due to the size of the battery and it takes about 2 hours to charge, which doesn't bother me.

Wayne,1/19/2025,"8gb of RAM & 256GB HDD, with a latest SnapDragon CPU, Four speakers, 2 top & bottom, offers good sound for little speakers, plus it has Dolby ATMOS. Very good battery life, more so in dark mode and battery saver. Fast opening of apps and good performance all around. Graphics very good and copes with everything but the serious gaming level, which would cost much more. It has a super metal alloy finish, and good quality glass, so get it protected with a tempered glass screen protector, and case for the Tablet body I think the likes of Samsung are going to be forced into dropping their prices, as an equivalent would be in the £500+ range, I used to buy Samsung tablets and their very good, but so are these with equivalent build and performance, plus being much cheaper. It arrives in a heavy stock cardboard box, and nicely packaged. Its rated as 10 WATT charging, but I can tell you if you get a 20 Watt charger you'll receive 17 watt charging fate, with ""fast charging"" appearing on the screen, so it can be charged respectively fast enough so not to hinder usage, buy a 3 meter lead and use while charging so you've plenty of lead to move about with. Comes preloaded with a latest version of Android, and receives regular updates. Plus it has a nice cleaning app built in. With very little blotware Apps.. For well under £200 you getting an 11"" screen alloy body with a lot of spec, very much well worth buying. They also do a 4GB RAM & 128GB version, and this also has great spec just less storage and RAM, but plenty to still be an excellent purchase.",5,Redmi Pad SE

Ali,9/5/2024,"Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE: A Budget Champion When it comes to affordable Android tablets, we often expect a familiar story: mediocre build quality, outdated internals, sluggish performance, and a short lifespan. But the Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE defies those expectations. It's the first Xiaomi device I've used, and I must say, I'm impressed—even though this is a budget tablet1. Here's why the Redmi Pad SE stands out: Impressive 90Hz Refresh Rate: What sets this tablet apart in its price range is its 90Hz refresh rate. Most budget-friendly tablets stick to the standard 60Hz, but the Redmi Pad SE steps up the game. With smoother animations, fluid transitions, and remarkably responsive scrolling, it feels surprisingly premium2. Solid Build Quality: The metal body of the Redmi Pad SE feels good in hand. Xiaomi didn't compromise on materials, and it shows. You won't mistake it for a flimsy paperweight anytime soon. Decent Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 4G, the tablet handles everyday tasks well. Whether you're browsing, streaming, or multitasking, it won't leave you frustrated. Multimedia Features: Quad Speakers: The Redmi Pad SE boasts quad speakers, making media consumption enjoyable. Expandable Storage: With 128GB of storage (expandable via microSD card), you won't run out of space for your apps and files. High-Refresh Display: The 11-inch IPS LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate ensures a pleasant viewing experience. Affordable Price: The Redmi Pad SE won't break the bank. At around $240 for the 128GB/8GB model, it's easy on your wallet. Plus, you get three color options: Mint Green, Graphite Gray, and Lavender Purple. Of course, there are some trade-offs: Graphics performance isn't mind-blowing. No official support for an active stylus. No fingerprint scanner.",5,Redmi Pad SE

Torg|Torg,6/3/2024,"Ich habe mir verschieden Tablets angeschaut.1. Lincplus T32. Xiaomi Redmi Pab SE3. Doogee T30 ProIch habe bisher das Medapad M5 lite LTE von Huawei seit Ende 2019. Leider fängt der Akku inzwischen zu schwächeln und Arbeitsspeicher, CPU und OS sind mitlerweile doch out. Da musste was neues her.Das Lincplus günstig mit 116,-€ aber Lautsprecher mies, Bild zu dunkel und keine Hoffnung auf Firmware Updates. Ging dann umgehend zuück.Das Redmi Pad hat sich gleich auf Android 14 upgedatet. Laut Website gibt es updates bis September 2026. Mit 8GB Ram und 256GB speicher auch für die nächste Zeit wohl ausreichend. Die CPU ist für mich vermutlich ausreichend schnell. Manchmal scheint das scrollen zu stocken, aber das kann auch an dem sehr glatten touch liegen. Der Sound wird mit dolby Atmos und Loudnes Funktion beworben. Besser wird es mit dem eingbauten Equalizer oder mit wavelet.Das Tablet ist sehr handlich aber ein bißchen eckig. 2 oder 3 Seiten der Einstellungen werden nur im Porträt-Modus angezeigt. Es kommt ohne Mobilfunk und erstaunlicherweise ohne Vibrationsmotor. Google Apps wie youtube, Google TV, Google Meet, Google One etc lassen weder deinstallieren noch deaktivieren. Wer es braucht ok, aber mich stört es wenn bei app updates diese dann angezeigt werden.Das Bild ist hell und die Farben ok aber nicht großartig unterschiedlich zum Doogee.Das Doogee macht einen guten Eindruck. Es ist wirklich sehr schnell und alle unerwünschten Google Apps lassen sich deaktivieren. Leider hat sich die Firmware nicht wie erwartet auf Android 14 aktualisiert. Mit der Anfrage an den Doogee Support bekam ich einen link zum Download der 14er Android Version (siehe Screenshots). Die beigefügte Anleitung ist nicht ganz klar, aber man kann sich das erarbeiten. Trotz der beworbenen Hifi Lautsprecher ist der der Klang blechern und auch mit den zwei Einstellungen zur Klangverbesserung nicht berauschend. Mit der App Wavelet (Equalizer) läßt sich das gröbste dann beheben. Die beigelegte Hülle stinkt leider stark. Beim ersten vollständigen Aufladen werden 100% angezeigt, wenn der Akku laut Accubattery app 6550 mAh anzeigt. Das Laden geht dann noch langsam weiter. Ich habe dann bei 7200 mAh Anzeige das Laden gestoppt. Angegeben sind 8500mAh. Das könnte sich mit mehrmaligen Laden noch verbessern.Das Bild ist bei normalen Gebrauch Innen hell genug. Die Farben lassen über 15 Stufen von warm nach kalt einstellen. Die automatische Helligkeit ragiert etwas sprunghaft. Das Tablet wird mitsammt der Hülle doch etwas schwer mit einer Hand zu halten.Ich häte nicht gedacht dass mir die Wahl eines neuen Tablets schwer fällt.Highlights are for Websurfen, Music videos and Prime Videos. Beruflich bedingt bin ich viel im Hotel und nicht überall kann an einen Firestick anschließen, daher ist mir ein guter Klang wichtig. Mein Mediapad hat ohne Klangeinstellung einen wesentlich bebesseren Klang (beworben mit Harman-Kardon), also fehlt mir zum schnellen Aufwecken bei allen Geräten ein Fingerabdrucksensor. Das M5 lite hat damals mit lte €229 gekostet und ich würde es mir mit etwas mehr Leistung und Speicher sofort wieder kaufen.|",4,Redmi Pad SE

It has 4 side speakers with Dolby DTS and sounds really good. The screen is an 11"" Full HD + which lacks a little verve and sharpness. That's where the price cut is noticeable. Not only in the 2000x1200 resolution but also in that it is not as sharp or vibrant as the Lenovo or Samsung. In other respects it performs quite well, internet browsing, movies, average games, doing most tasks quite quickly.

BruceBatMan,12/6/2024,"Aside from simply browsing the internet and checking email etc, which every tablet should be able to do, there are two main reasons to get this tablet IMHO.It excels at drawing.  It's been a while since I've looked into drawing tablets - back in the day if you wanted a good tablet for drawing you got a mid screen and all it did was draw.  No internet, nothing.  This is a full fat tablet (that basically does the role of a desktop or laptop for your average user) and it has a great pen experience.  I've been drawing with krita, which is a very feature dense program and there is no lag.The other thing it does great is media.  The screen is awesome and the speakers are surprisingly loud.  Because it's in the android ecosystem you can run Firefox as your browser and get ublock origin meaning you never have to see ads as long as you're using Firefox (notably for YouTube). The tablet also natively will keep playing YouTube when you turn off the screen.  Or at least it does with Firefox - never had any desire to download the app, frankly.  The screen is big enough to be a significant improvement over even a large phone. But not so big that it feels hard to be portable.The other half of media is games.  Obviously this is not a gaming PC.  It's not going to run any real heavy duty games.  But if you want it for mobile games especially card games like slay the spire, legends of runeterra, or hearthstone, then this is just basically the perfect device for them.  The screen has great color and contrast, so since graphical fidelity is not the limiter with these, they can actually look better on this than a PC because the screen is great.  It's also basically the perfect size for card games.  Large enough to feel like the full primo experience, but small enough you don't feel like you are dragging your finger across miles of realestate for every action.Seems the one place that isn't amazing is the battery.  The battery is fine.  It's not bad, it's not great.  It will last you long enough, but it's not going to knock your socks off.Unless you have a really specific reason that you absolutely NEED a larger screen or something, I can't really imagine recommending a different tablet at the moment.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
AnotherUser,8/25/2024,"Bought this on discount.  Definitely worth the price at the point.  With the S-Pen and the good usability of the tablet, I find it very useful for browsing and doing minor edits in Google Docs, etc.  The battery life is pretty decent, and the screen and sound is pretty good for watching videos.  Better than the Kindle 10 fire.So if you only want to watch videos / browse and not do much else, buying a Kindle 10 Fire on discount is probably a better deal.  Though if you want to do more productivity stuff, the S-Pen that comes with it is very handy.  There are plenty of affordable and sturdy cases for this device that will also hold the pen.In terms of speed, it works fine.  But if you've used an iPad Pro, you will notice it has more of a lag when loading new web pages.  Not enough to matter, but to be noted if you're used to the rapid loading speeds. Upon initial device setup, there's a lot of software updates, etc. which makes the lag more noticeable until they're all done.Finally, you can also consider the Samsung FE tablet, which is more premium table for more money.  I ended up sticking with this one, not because of the price, but because that one is about 20% heavier, and this lightweight tablet made it so easy to carry and use.  Also, there are sometimes trade programs to get the FE tablet.  If you use this one for a few years, then pay a little bit to get more for a new FE tablet, then it's an even better deal.  But you can't go wrong with the FE tablet now too if you're in the market for a more powerful device.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
PD,1/20/2025,"I have been using the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) for several months. It was easy to transfer information from my Samsung phone to the tablet - even for someone in her 70s. In a short amount of time, I transferred all my favorite apps and pictures. I have a laptop but the tablet is lighter in weight and easier to use on the go or when watching TV. The memory is adequate for my needs and I especially like the stylus. The tablet charges in a short amount of time and I have no complaints about the length of the charge. The speed and clarity are great.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Charles Childers,5/20/2024,"I have this as a secondary tablet, alongside an M1 iPad Pro 11"".The Tab S6 Lite is no where near as powerful, but that's ok. It's still a quite usable tablet, with solid construction and good battery life.My main use cases: taking notes with Samsung Notes, reading books (FBReader, Bible Study by Olive Tree), playing games (nothing demanding, mostly Stardew Valley, Another Eden, and some emulation of older consoles), programming (under Termux), music (YT Music) and audio books (Audible). All of these work well on it. It takes a little longer to start some of the games than my iPad, but they run fine once loaded. It's not great for multitasking. I've found that using two apps in split screen is ok. It feels a bit sluggish with three on screen. When running larger games it'll have to restart apps when switching. None of this is problematic for me, but it's worth noting.Battery life has been good so far. On my longest day with it I started using it about 10 AM, and plugged it in at 11 PM with 29% remaining battery. During that time I only had the screen off for two hours, and it was otherwise in continual use. (I run about 25-30% brightness). About half of that time was spent reading, and the rest was a mix of playing Stardew Valley, taking notes, and programming under Termux.Notetaking is pretty nice. The included S Pen works well, and attaches magnetically to the top. It does not need charging, so is always ready to use. My son (more artistically inclined than I) says it's not as good at pressure sensitivity as the Apple Pencil, but he had no complaints with the feel or accuracy.The build quality is fine. The tablet is a little heavy, but feels solid. It's a touch more slippery than I'd like, but this hasn't actually been a problem. I have no other complaints on this.The display is a bit of a let down. The resolution is fine, but there's a bit of backlight bleed along the edge with the USB C port. It also has a lot of glare. I can mostly ignore these, but they are sometimes a bit problematic.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Jet,1/18/2025,"Charges fast, surf the web easy. Loads fast when loading a web page. Easy to use. Durability is strong.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Amazon Customer,8/28/2024,"I have found this tablet to be a nice size, weight, and easy to set up to use.  I transferred information from my cell phone without a hitch, other than for the few programs that required that some data be entered again for privacy and protection purposes.  Every tablet I have ever had has used battery power much more quickly than cell phones, and this one is typical in that respect.  They are also slower to recharge, as a rule, and this one is typical in that regard.  However, I did buy a charger for this tablet that had a higher speed and charge strength than what I use on my cell phone.  I found that the tablet charged very quickly with this charger, so some of the people who had charging issues might want to do the same.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Yamilet Rocha|Yamilet Rocha,8/23/2024,"I'm a Junior in engineering at college this year so I got tired of carrying my notebooks so bad, this has become my best friend.I've been trying my tablet for over a month now and it is now one of my essential tools everyday.For note making I stick to the Samsung Notes app and I have no issues at all for work, it helps me get everything organized and pretty with the customization of the pages and grids available. I've been doing a couple of classes over the summer and it has been great writing down everything digitally, since I pass those notes frequently onto my computer I had no issues at all.And as for drawing there aren't any great apps such as procreate but I was able to work with the app called sketchbook, it has really simple features and options but being free and all is actually a life saver.Of course, as another recommendation try and buy the protector screen and the case, using the pen so much might scratch so it's best to pay a little more for that protection.Also buying an SD card is a game changer, I expect myself to do tons of notes and already have many games installed so that was only for me, but it's not like any other apple device that storage runs out really fast, I've tried ipads before but im more fond of android systems, plus the battery lasts so much.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
James,10/30/2024,"Hello everyone ??, who’s considering this tablet.This is a pretty mediocre tablet, but it does a decent job. The problems I have with it, is that it’s not very future proof, let alone a current day proof. The 60hz refresh should have a variable option for at least 90hz in my opinion, especially for gaming. Nice looking decent sized display, it’s what Samsung does best. Great battery life, would last days without barely dipping the battery percentages. But storage and ram? 4gbs of ram and 64gb worth of storage is very underwhelming especially for a 2024 device. You can get the more storage model or buy your own micro ssd for more storage which is a plus. But wouldn’t have the as quick read and write speed as the internal. But 4 gbs is starting to be really cutting it for most daily operations. Especially if you have multiple apps opened. The S pen is great but durability lacks a bit. My pen nib wore out after only 2 months of usage. If you are an artist and wanted to get this tablet I recommend getting a paper screen cover and a metal nib. It’ll feel way better.Being the lite version. This tablet loses some features from the other models. One being the full dex experience and which was a main reason I got an Samsung tablet. Shouldve done more research. Found out that it doesn’t support hdmi output. Which is a big letdown. You can use a wireless version but the input lags makes it a bit unbearable. Even my old Samsung Galaxy S9+ phone supports hdmi output and does an amazing job at it. It’s unfortunate they cheap out on that.It’s a decent tablet for kids or teens, but there’s a lot better options especially for the price.If you can do your research or market hunting, finding a used S8 or even an S7 would be a way better experince. If you want a bigger display, an A9+ 128gb model has 8gbs around the same price. I find that to be more future proofing but it doesn’t have the pen. If you want to go new the S9FE especially if it’s on sale for like $300 it’s more worth it in my opinion. Even an older iPad would be more worth it.Thanks for reading! Good luck on tablet shopping, I hope y'all find the tablet that fits your needs. It could be this tablet. It just didn’t for me. ?? well have a good day yall!",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Esther,11/10/2024,"It lags sometimes, especially during startup.  4 gb RAM is Not Enough!  This needs 6 gb RAM in order to operate more smoothly.  Also, the motion smoothness is not good, i think it's 60 Hz- i almost returned it because the scrolling is blurry, but I just scroll slower.  Wish it would give you a smoother refresh rate, like 120 Hz.Also I got a bookcover/stand that also works to 'wake' your tablet.  I finally was able to find a way to turn that off, as it was affecting the touchscreen a lot.  I still find that when I'm watching a video, the magnet part of the bookcover still occasionally interferes, freezing the touchscreen of my tablet, but if i move the bottom (magnetic part of the cover), I'm able to start using the touchscreen again.  They need to fix this, as I never had this problem with my Galaxy Tab S2 and it also has the magnet cover.The Smaller size of this tablet is perfect- that'swhy I gave it 4 instead of 3 stars.  Sadly, it's the Only newer Samsung tablet with a smaller, portable size.  The other newer Samsung Tablets are TOO BIG AND TOO RECTANGULAR!!  If I'm watching a video in bed (or anywhere) i dont need a Big screen in front of me- it strains the eyes!It would be nice if they made a tablet in this small size with better options, like higher RAM, better motion smoothness, on screen fingerprint reader, etc.  It would also be nice if they stopped making them so rectangular but rather more square, like the Ipads.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
AmazonCustomerReview,1/10/2025,"I got a Samsung tablet since I have a Samsung phone and hoped the process of hooking it up would be smooth. Sure, everything worked great except I couldn't charge it, because it only came with a cord with 2 USB C ends! So I had to order yet another gadget - an adapter, just to get it charged so I could set it up. Very annoying. But it seems to have copied over all my apps and almost everything set up ok. One app still isn't working on it. But I'll keep trying. It did take all day to get it set up. I do recommend this one, but you will need an adapter to charge it.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Adriano's Mom,12/21/2024,"This is my third Samsung tablet. The other two still work, but as the operating systems stop updating and battery life fails, you wind up getting another. I primarily use the tablets to store music and videos for my fiddle and mandolin playing and Irish stepdancing. Since considerations for gaming and video are not part of my usage, these tablets work fine. The fact that I can store stuff on a micro SD card means I can move my data from tablet to tablet with very little interruption in my use. My only complaint is that the 10"" size, while nice for videos (especially for dance steps), is less comfortable for my small hands. My earlier tablets were 7"", but it seems like those are being replaced by the larger standard.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

Andrea Lenski,8/24/2024,"This is the third Samsung tablet that I have purchased over the last 12 years. I am a loyal and happy Samsung customer. First tablet lasted for years! Second one not as long but that's on me. I should have purchased one with more memory since my gaming habits increased but it was still a great product. So I decided to purchase a new tablet with more memory and more capability to manage my increased usage beyond games.I received my tablet promptly and was extremely happy with my purchase. Went to bed one night with the tablet working and when I got up in the morning it was dead. Not completely dead but just a flickering screen and no way to turn off or reboot. I guess I got a lemon. Sometimes this happens and a product is just defective. So I began the return process. I would still buy this tablet again but Amazon did not give me an option to replace.Instead of getting a shipping label, I got an insert for the package and instructions telling me that the UPS man would pick up the package and bring me the label and that I needed to be home for the next several days for when he showed up. I was dubious but gave it a fair shot. Monday three I called the UPS number provided to me and was told that there was not a pick up scheduled and that I should contact Amazon. I live in a relatively rural area and honestly UPS doesn't do scheduled pick ups. We have a local business that also is a UPS drop off center that has dedicated staff for UPS service. So I brought my package and instructions to the drop off and the staff tried to figure out a return option on my Amazon account but ended up giving me the Amazon number and instructed me to explain to them that I need an actual mailing label and that we don't have scheduled pick- ups locally except for the drop off center. I called Amazon and explained my situation. The first representative I talked was courteous and tried to be helpful but admitted she could not figure it out so she was transferring me to a ""specialist"".Wow. This so-called specialist was terrible. I told her I am literally at a staffed UPS center as we speak and we could get this resolved now but that the scheduled pickup really wasn't a viable option. She completely ignored anything I said and just continued to process this the way she wanted and then told me that it would get picked up in the next 7 days and of course I need to be present for the pickup. She tried to justify this by saying that because of the value of the product, it needed to be handed to the courier. Okay, but I am at the UPS center with an actual human being who can address this issue so it really is not an issue at all.Now I have to call UPS on Monday and make sure there is a pickup scheduled (doubtful) and then call and bug Amazon to get it right and continue this for how long? No. I am going to drive to the actual UPS hub that's 20 miles away on Tuesday if this is not completely in place on Monday. From Friday morning to Monday is long enough to schedule a pickup.I am honestly aggravated by the whole experience. Last word, buy Samsung but think about if you should buy it on Amazon because if you have to return it then it will be a NIGHTMARE. Apparently it makes sense to Amazon that a person will be home and available for an entire week for a package to get picked up. 2 stars because it's a good product and glitches happen but Amazon gets a negative rating on customer service in this case.Update: finally got this picked up and the UPS man asked ""why couldn't you bring this to the UPS at Toner Planet"" lol. He said they can print the label just as easily. Well, just relieved it got picked up. Hopefully the return is now hassle free.",2,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
sherri henry chesnut,9/13/2024,"The screen was surprisingly dim, even after adjusting the Display Settings.  The tablet was supposed to be new, but the seal on its box was broken on arrival.  Everything inside looked okay, but I wondered if the LCD screen on all S6 Lite tablets are as light and dim as mine was.  I'm used to an AMOLED screen on my Galaxy phone, so when this tablet's screen was so dim, I ordered a Galaxy S8+ Plus tablet with AMOLED screen, and its screen was fabulous!  Bright, rich colors and crisp, vivid images.  Totally different than this S6 Lite.  Researched this tablet before ordering.  Also read reviews, and others have praised this tablet's screen.  So maybe since mine had been opened, it just wasn't working quite right.  Everything else, like the battery life, was great!  And the pink gold color of the back of the tablet was gorgeous.  The screen image was my only complaint, but it was just so super dim and washed out looking, I just wasn't happy with it, so returned the tablet.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

Amazon Customer,8/10/2024,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite runs into some performance issues, especially when attempting to multitask. 4 gbs of RAM is just too low. For multimedia purposes, the device performs decent enough. It has a good display, and enough performance to run lower end 2d games. The design still feels reasonably modern-esque.In a lot of things in raw specs, this thing isn't that well positioned in the market. the 128 GB version of the A9+, when on sale, goes for 11 bucks or so more and 8 gbs of RAM and a 90hz display instead of 60. And that's just a direct Samsung example. However, the main thing this device has going for it is coming with a remarkably solid stylus, and performing well enough at things involving that stylus. Lenovo is notorious for software issues. There is no other device on the market with that combination of excellent stylus support, software support, and being outright dirt cheap relative to other more noteworthy stylus and tablet combos.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

Larry W.,9/25/2024,This is the second S6 I purchased for my daughters in college.  They are great for note taking in class especially with the included S pen.  The screen is a good size but tablet still compact enough for the small desks in lecture halls. Great alternative to carrying around a laptop when it's not needed.  It would be nice if the tablet has a built in holder for the S pen so it would not get lost and protected. Only complaint I have is it comes with a USB C to USB C cable but no charger.,4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

Placeholder,7/17/2024,"The initial setup took a little while but that is to be expected with a new phone, tablet, etc.  The tablet is speedy, well designed, Samsung has some useful apps that come preinstalled and since I have an android phone I had my email, text messages and favorite apps up and running quickly. It is a great tablet at a reasonable price.The only negative is that the pen skips when drawing.  I decided to purchase a V-Pen to see if it was the pen or the tablet causing the problem, and the V-Pen works flawlessly with my drawing apps.  I was relieved to discover the problem was just the S pen. Product support (Samsung and Amazon) confirmed that I would have to send the tablet back in order to get a new pen (and tablet), which is the last thing I wanted to do after I had it all set up, so I decided to purchase some pen tips for the S pen to see if that fixes the problem.  The tip is wobbly, and I don't know enough about these pens to know whether or not that is normal. It's not really a problem because I like the V-Pen a lot,  but it would be nice to have a backup and know what was wrong with the S pen. (No, I'm affiliated with V Pen, it was a good choice for me!) I didn't see a need to give the tablet a less than 5 star rating because of the pen - the tablet is great, just be aware of the fact that the tablet has to go back too in the event the pen has issues and you need a new one. 5 stars!",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Micah L.,10/6/2024,"I bought this during a flash sale, thinking I would update my tablet and wanted the included pen. For my purposes, the Lite model is ok.

The battery on my 2017 lasts 30-40% longer.",4,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

Daniel,1/24/2025,"Great tablet. Size is good and though slow at times it can handle plenty of books and games. The only problem is the s pen- the tip has started popping out of place only after a month of use, not even everday. Disappointed but otherwise great tablet",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

No-Go,8/21/2024,"I was excited to get this tablet even after reading through some negative reviews. I thought “how bad can the experience really be if this is one of the more popular Samsung tabs?”. Well, worse than I expected. The screen is not good and has uneven lighting that makes everything look washed out. I was not expecting it to be great, but I can’t believe Samsung would use this in any of their hardware. The tablet also instantly lagged upon going thru initial setup. It continued to lag and have unresponsive touches the whole time I tried to use it after setup.Three Pros I have are 1) the back facing camera quality is actually halfway decent. 2) The build quality also feels decent, as it’s a glass front and aluminum back. 3) It’s fairly lightweight.Otherwise, most things about this tablet are mediocre. Screen, speed, ram, front facing camera. I didn’t try out the charging so I can’t speak to that. For the price, most would be much better off going with the base model 9th generation iPad. The base model iPad is still high quality in most anspects and currently around the same price as this galaxy tab s6 lite. I would only consider getting this if you absolutely had to have an android tablet and your budget can’t stretch any further. But don’t expect it to come close to a more pricey android tablet or any iPad. I really think Samsung should step up their game and offer better value for their lower end tablets when it comes to hardware and experience. This isn’t it.",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
Amazon Customer,1/6/2025,"I hate how Samsung nickle and dimes you to death. Everything you need to use the table is ""sold separately"". But you don't know that till it arives and you  can't use it because you don't have the connector or usb, and don't know until you open the package. Why can't they just send you everything and raise the price, which is not cheap to begin with.",3,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

I synced and copied everything via my iPad. It was very similar in looks to the iPad which I sold after I checked this Samsung Tablet against the iPad. It is very easy to use and is lightweight and a good size for my needs. It took a day to make sure that my phone and this tablet were totally synced and all of the apps were updated and working properly. I do a lot of customizing to my devices via wallpaper, adding folders, checking all apps, etc. I had no use for the S Pen since I could not use it as a stylus. I have two stylus pens that I use.

Ro,7/4/2024,"Prior to the Samsung S6 Lite, had the Amazon HD 10 + tablet,which was not a bad tablet for what I payed for. The S6 Lite 2024 Edition is leaps and bounds much better. Has only dual speakers not quad but the sound quality is so good helps that there is Dolby Atmos. At first was not keen on the S pen, after utilizing it found it as one of the best aspects of the S6. Having a built in GPS sensor is something I love about the tablet as I have transformed it as my main infotainment for my car and having Google maps to navigate on a 10.4 inch screen is much better than using my cell phone. Watching videos is great love the 2000 x 1200 screen resolution. Even though it only has 4 gig of ram, have not experienced any lag and being only 60 hz refresh no stutter. It's fast and snappy. Came preinstalled with Android 14, and from what I have read Samsung should support it at least up to Android 17 for the 2024 version, you may want to do your own research on it to make sure.",5,Galaxy Tab S6 Lite

Joe L|Joe L,7/29/2024,"This tablet is more than enough for my needs.The speed, graphics, crisp and vibrant screen, all make for a wonderful experience. I was originally looking into the ultra, but I couldn't justify the purchase when the only real differences are screen, speaker and ram related, and nothing i'll do with it will really max out the current specs. The speakers sound amazing on this thing. Most tablets just have cheap tinny speakers just to fill the spaces while the Galaxy S line seems to have had a lot of thought put into sound quality. The camera is quite decent as well. Not top of the line, but for a tablet, it takes some pretty clear photos.It charges quite fast as well, and stays charged for a while, even with heavy game play, just like my S23 U. I did about 3 hours of straight play on war universe and it was still around 80% when I shut it down.I did make sure to get an illuminated magnetic keyboard case, and a high speed 512gb Samsung Micro SD card for it. Don't need them, just wanted to get them and got a good deal. The next thing I get will be a bluetooth mouse to complete the laptop feel. lolThis is the best tablet for the money in my eyes.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Anonymous Geek,10/16/2024,"Bought this tablet to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 which wasn't able to be updated any more. The S9 is noticeably faster and the video quality is excellent, seemingly even better than the S6. I use VLC software to play videos and the new tablet shows no lag and no drops/stalls. Transferring my data from the S6 was done using SmartSwitch (highly recommended) and the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with the S9. This was really very fast. Loading new videos to the S9 from my PC was also fast, much faster than for the S6. No issues at all. Highly recommended.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Julian,8/23/2024,"Originally, I bought this Tablet with the intent to use it for gaming. Ultimately, I found that there is so much more you can get out of it than that.Its a very thin, lightweight tablet. The screen is an impressive size that felt larger in my hands than I had expected. I was originally considering going for the Ultra, but the size of the S9+ is more than enough for what I need. I actually feel more comfortable using this tablet without the protective case that I purchased for it when at home. I didn't even bother putting on the protective glass screen I bought for it because I don't see myself abusing this tablet as hard as I abuse my phone.The performance is fantastic. This has no problem playing whatever games you might want to play on it and the refresh rate is superb. As someone who regularly uses a high refresh rate monitor, I can appreciate seeing similar performance on a tablet.What I wasn't expecting when I bought this was how much I could get out of Samsung's Second Screen app. This built in application allows you to wirelessly connect your Samsung tablet to your PC and use it as an additional monitor. As someone who regularly uses a laptop for work, its a game changing asset to have. The integration is seamless; you can even choose to enable the touchscreen so that you could browse through documents like you would with a kindle without having to go through the hassle of doing file transfers.However with performance comes a price. It goes without saying that these tablets are pretty damn expensive. If I had to make a recommendation, I would suggest settling for the S9 which my friend bought and is more than satisfied with. Most of what you are getting out of making the jump to the S9+ or Ultra is a larger screen size. Visit your local electronics store and see which one is right for you.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Dnl,9/6/2024,"In today's tech market, all products are expensive.  The Samsung Tab S9 is an amazing device and out performs all other tablets, imo.

PhillyGirl,2/11/2024,"My previous Samsung Note tablet circa 2014 is very old. Not wanting to purchase a new tablet I reformatted it hopefully to bring it back to life. But its old and not useful for todays apps. About a year or more has passed before looking again at the tablet world.  I rocked a Samsung not 8 phone well past its use and recently upgraded to a S23. I absolutely love the S-pen and S-Note. My new tablet had to be pen capable. Just using a pen is way different than pen features baked into the ecosystem of the device.Enter the S9 tablet family. I played around with the idea of getting by with one from the S8 family because of expense, but I like bells and whistles. I also intend to have this tablet for many years, so OS updating is important.I picked the Samsung S9 plus. Amazon was offering it with 512gb with 13 percent off which was 30 bucks cheaper than the 256gb version. I've played the available built in storage game before.  I'll be using this tablet for a variety of functions so having the larger  space for apps and all of my projects will be nice.Test...First I charge to full capacity before turning it onI then used Samsung's transfer tool and copied my apps from my S23 to the S9 plus tablet. This worked without a hitch.Let those apps updateUpdate the OS under settingsPlay time....Audio-I read that the sound of this tablet was superb so I head to play something from my Amazon collection before heading to YouTube to play some videos. It has rich bass and volume.Video-I played a video from my digital library, Amazon, YouTube and Vudu. Colors were nice and bright so no surprises thereS-pen-Although they were creative with the magnetic back storage, I wished it was like the phone and my old tablet with the S-pen stored inside. The pen itself is pleasantly thicker than anticipated. Samsung made a good move in matching the color of both the pen and tablet. There's a lot of features to learn if you care to. The included S-notes is a beast of a program, but you can also use other programs like OneNote.The only thing with the form of this tablet is it is long horizontally. So when holding that way it seems a bit long. I rather like the more square shape of my old tablet. There's a lot to learn about the features and youtube is a great tutor. Even just now typing this out one came to me with holding down the Ctrl key. It lights up the letters y, a, z, x, c and v which are shortcuts for specific functions. Very cool!When you get it, pay attention to the return policy and use it to death within that time frame. This is already long so I may update only if I come across an issue that impacts negatively.It is pricey, but it is a premium feature tablet. You can get cheaper with going with lesser specs.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Sam,12/30/2024,"Love this tablet, it runs fast and switches smoothly from app to app. The landscape mode is the only thing I don't really like, it will only turn one direction to watch in landscape which is not convenient. I would check to see when the newest one will be released before spending over 1K on a tablet though. You could end up with an older tablet when the newest is coming out in a month or so.Battery life is great, I use it every day & listen to it all night every night. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to transport or travel with. Easily pairs with any Bluetooth keyboard and any other BT devices.",4,Galaxy Tab S9

ShareBear,8/21/2024,"** 3 Month update ***I’ve set up a reliable Dex ecosystem for my Samsung tablet, Caldigit TS4 to expand the number of ports available, wired mouse and keyboard, and a monitor (HP Omen). With this setup I can run Dex flawlessly (Dex is a built in desktop operating system that comes with Samsung smart phones and tablets)My primary uses for this device are Google workspace (you have to use the chrome browser for all features, the apps are functional, but lack a lot of editing features), web based management systems, and media.The stock speakers are great (comparable to laptop speakers, a little tinny, but generally sound great for the device class)The screen is gorgeous, and as a stand alone tablet you can absolutely use Dex with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard on the fly, managing a couple windows side by side feels comfortable (not too small)Could this replace your laptop? So long as you don’t rely on specific software. Absolutely, this would be great for student or business owners on the go. Not too big to bring with you, but not too small to be unusable.This thing has exceeded my expectation for sure. Same internals as the ultra tab, smaller screen.Perfect for excel, google sheets, word processing, and when paired with mouse and keyboard is effectively functional as an ultra portable laptop.If most of your work is web based or general word processing 10/10 I’d recommend.Haven’t had any issues with lagging, overheating, or battery health.I do recommend adjusting your battery settings to prevent it from charging past 80%, and while it is convenient disabling fast charging will help preserve the battery life in the long run.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
S. Reyes,10/4/2024,"First off this tablet is great! My recommendation is to price around once a week and see the various colors they offer. It changes! When I bought this one, the beige was cheaper than the black. Then the following week when my husband wanted one. Both of them where at the same price and a few cents more expensive then what I bought mine.I got this tablet to replace my laptop. Don't get me wrong I would rather be on my laptop but due to a wrist injury I can't lift much without help or being in pain. So this is why I got it.I'm a samsung user in general so the setup was easy for me. Everyone's learning curve is different. Wifi is good but the downside it will try to connect to everything! Even the neighbors stuff! Changing and keeping the charge is fine but it drains quickly if I'm watching youtube or playing a moblie game like Honkai: Star Rail. I think I can get 4 hours of Honkai without and be at 10%.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Vakmere,8/17/2024,"Pro: Great screen and sharpness. Very fast going to any screen, browser, menu scrolling, easy to learn more about all its functions by going on YouTube. I got the 512G memory so plenty of space there. Got a nice case for it. Easy-to-use keyboard is also a plus. Synch easily to my Samsung phone as the Quick Share makes short work of transferring data and apps to this tablet. There's more positives however the fun is exploring it. Bluetooth finds your printers easily and is very useful.  Games are handled very well. Syncs to any other Samsung appliance, TV, and others. Screen protector is something you'll need to decide on. S-Pen is very useful, a learning curve is needed buy easily learned.Con: I don't like Google Sheets or Docs. Very annoying to use especially if you are used to Microsoft Works. To use MS Excel or Word here a subscription is need. Using Google Sheets and docs takes a few YouTube video searches. Can be very confusing trying to find files.No SD slot. No earphones jack. No 5G unless you specifically get one with it. Useless outdoors away from a WIFI signal. Battery does drain a little faster than I'd like and fast charging isn't really that fast.Summary: You'll like this tablet. Screen size is just right and updated regularly the functionality is very high. Screen is very reactive with touch and quick. You'll like it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9

Alana Duncan,9/17/2023,"Tablets and I typically don't get along, especially on the Android side of things, which is why my enthusiasm for this tablet has really caught me by surprise. I've owned a few Android tablets, an iPad Mini, and a little Surface tablet -- and mostly these experiences taught me that, just maybe, tablets aren't for me. I always missed having a cursor, or having a keyboard that wasn't a case, or, most of all, programs on my desktop (or even just my Chromebook). So I kind of turned my back on tablets for a while. I was using my two-in-one Samsung Chromebook 2 as a tablet, but the myriad of issues that have recently cropped up on that device made me want to try an actual tablet again.Enter the S9. I've loved this thing from the moment I unboxed it. Calling the color 'beige' almost seems like an insult; it's a nice, silvery white that really makes the device stand out, and the matching color of the S Pen is a nice touch. And the screen is absolutely gorgeous, I can't stop admiring it whenever I wake it up. The colors and brightness are really great, and you can fine tune the latter for your needs. I haven't tried using it in a full blast of sunlight, yet, but it's excelled everywhere else. Portability is a breeze since the S9 is so light. Even with the case I have for it, which adds a bit of heft, it's still much easier to carry around than my Chromebook. And the functionality! I have the Samsung Flip 5 and the Samsung Buds Live, and the S9 interfaces with both of them flawlessly. I can look at messages from my phone (and it also grabbed a bunch of info from it, saving me time) and listen to both my tablet and my phone on my Buds Live, among other things. Gone are the days that I need to pack a separate headset/earphones for my tablet and my phone. It's such a stream-lined setup, I love it.This is ordinarily where I would list all of my cons, but I don't have a lot, honestly. My only dissatisfaction is how expensive the S9's Samsung accessories are (how much for the covers? oof!), and how limited, but maybe more will spring up in time. I used to dislike how limited apps were on Android tablets, but now you can get a huge plethora of apps that connect to your destktop versions. It really just depends on what you use and how you work.So, yeah. I love this thing, as you can tell. I've written this review on it, even. If you need a tablet spruce-up in your life, and you own some other Samsung products, I recommend this one.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
lawyer in Pittsburgh,7/17/2024,"I mainly bought this my first tablet device to take notes on in a way that would store my notes in an easily accessible place and be available to me across devices (on my phone and PC as well). I am having trouble getting my notes from OneNote to synch to the cloud so that my other devices can see them. That is more of a software issue. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 NotePaper Screen Panel to improve the writing experience for note taking, which was an improvement. I did not love the writing experience on the bare screen. Too slippery, and too much unintentional palm interaction with screen. I also bought a Dexnor keyboard case for it, which works pretty well, but it is not a great typing experience. Just useful in a pinch. It has good battery life and seems to have good processor speed. All in all I am not sure this was a wise investment to try to transition to digital note taking, away from paper. It remains to be seen if I stick with it or switch back to paper. I have to get the synching working to stick with it.",4,Galaxy Tab S9

Doc Jim,9/10/2024,"Finally! A tablet that delivers performance like I have never seen before in an android tablet. Fast screen refresh time and very responsive GPU and CPU. I did have a problem using the smartswitch app. While trying to use smartswitch to copy my phone contents into the tablet, the app wanted to update but was unable to. I allowed the tablet to complete its installation and initialization and when it was done, I updated the smartswitch app then tried again this time with glowing success.I have some concerns with the expected lifetime of this tablets amoled screen but I have read that Samsung has taken steps to prevent burnin and other screen problems.If you want solid performance in an android tablet then this is the one to get. I would not recommend giving this level of tablet to a child.I wold have also purchased the book case keyboard with it had it been available,",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Vincent Van Gopher,8/21/2024,"This tablet is so fast and has a great screen and surprisingly good sound for something so thin.  A relative actually had to ask me to turn it down when I was playing a news broadcast in the next room while they were on the phone.  I wish my Chromebook sounded this good. The fingerprint sensor is super fast and reliable. It also holds a charge really well.  It doesn't run down quickly when in heavy use, and when I just leave it on for a couple days without using it much, it's still above 90 percent on Day 3.IMHO the Android system is much more user-friendly than Apple's, and I have a Samsung phone, so it was especially quick and easy to set it up with the apps I like to use -- it all transferred over by logging in, basically.  I still have to learn all the features, like using Dex, pop-up screens, and the stylus.I do like the form factor of the iPad slightly better -- prefer the more rounded edges. Otherwise, this is pretty much perfect.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

I'm so pleased with my choice! the snapdragon processor is fast and smooth, the new screen glass provides extra protection,  for me,that's a great thing,  wifi is awesome fast and no problems. love the on screen touch buttons and you barely have to tap the screen for responding,  nice and sensitive! this size is very portable! this tablet can do so much more, it's like a mini laptop. Excellent blacks and the 4k is mind blowing,  you can't go wrong with Samsung!

danny,1/1/2025,Got for Christmas to replace my other samsung tablet. It works great and is faster than my last tablet. My only problem is that they have so many different options and it is hard to get the best one. You just don't know what options are the best for your money or your just getting ripped off buy paying for something that is the same as the another one that is cheaper. Samsung changes just one word and then charges even more money for something that is the same.,3,Galaxy Tab S9
Biggles,5/18/2024,"When I first started setup, I had a major issue with this product. It damped what should have been an exciting time. The tablet is definitely a superstar, but I had an issue getting the Samsung keyboard to show up. This is my 4th Samsung tablet, so it's not like I'm some newbie. I won't drag this out, but it took an online video for me to find the missing component. After that, the magic began. This is the reason that I'm giving the tablet, a definite 5 star, a 4 star rating. It shouldn't take online videos to get the startup successfully completed. I'll still buy Samsung products and still love them, but I wish this could have gone more smoothly. I definitely recommend this tablet and hope your purchase goes smoothly. ETA:  this is a rewrite of my original posting as I always want to be as fair as possible in my reviews.",4,Galaxy Tab S9
pancho,8/14/2023,"So far, the Tablet has been amazing. This is the first time I own a tablet, so I was really satisfied with the size of the S9. To be honest, I was going to buy the S9 Ultra until I realized that I just wanted it for reading and perhaps basic gaming (i.e. Dead cells, gacha games, etc.). I was worried about the S9 since I did not know what to expect for 11', but it has been great and works well. If you are planning to use the tablet as a book, video watcher, and basic gaming, I believe the S9 will suffice. Since I already have a great laptop, I realized that a bigger size was useless for me. So, the size for a consumer that is planning to use it for basic functions will be happy to know that the S9 is more than enough.I like the design of this Tablet; it looks super nice, and the included pen helps a lot when maneuvering around the screen. Actually, I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, which is old, but it came with a pen as well, but I never used it; however, with the table, I believe it is critical since it is too big for me to reach the top of the screen (And this is an 11', I cannot imagine how hard would have been if I had a bigger one).The only bad thing I can think of is not with the Table itself but with this listing, they tell you it will come with a ""FREE"" book cover, but I didn't receive it. Amazon was nice enough to give me a partial refund, but now I have no cover T_T. So yeah, don't expect a free book cover. Actually, this is why I lowered the rating since the product itself is fantastic. Nonetheless, the retailer failed to provide me with what they promised. Even when I went to their website, they didn't help at all! It was annoying since they will be like go here, go there to end up not getting anything and wasting time.TL;DR: The tablet is great, comes with a nice pen, and is beautifully designed. However, they didn't give me a book cover. Nonetheless, Amazon helped me by giving me a partial refund.",4,Galaxy Tab S9
Mary H.,7/29/2024,"I moved up from a 5 year old 10"" Samsung Galaxy tablet to this one and have not been disappointed. It has great color and fast processing. There are a lot of features new to this one that I still am learning to use. The S Pen is convenient and the camera takes excellent pictures. The screen is big enough and has great clarity so I can put it on my lap and watch movies in bed. The only drawbacks are the weight (it's heavy) and the battery life which I don't think is as great as Samsung promotes it to be. I did buy a protective cover for it which of course increased the weight. I bought it on sale on an Amazon Prime day so overall I'm happy with this purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
David C. Harris,5/18/2024,"I had never been an Android tablet user and I received a Samsung A7 Lite from T-Mobile supposedly for free, but it was not free. The A7 Lite was very under powered and could not keep up with program/app demands. I had been very pleased that I could put apps on the tablet that I really did not want on my phone. I used the Fit-Bit app as well as the Toyota app quite often, but they were slow. After about 2 years and a number of app & OS updates, the Fit-Bit and Toyota apps were almost worthless; the Toyota app was taking days to update my car's charging history, and the Fit-Bit app took 3 or 4 synchronizations, and still might not be accurate; I thought the problems were with the service and not my A7 tablet. I took a chance on this S9 because it had more memory and a more powerful processor, and boy, I could not be happier. My Toyota charging history has been up to date within hours, and the Fit-Bit data is a one-and-done when synchronizing.  My old A7 would not stream my video from my Synology NSA, but the S9 has no problem. I am very, very happy with my S9 purchase.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Verified Customer,9/16/2024,"Its a Samsung so you know it is a great quality tablet. Super fast and holds a charge for a long time. Screen makes images look great. I did reject the order because it was supposed to be overnight and I needed it. I went to Best Buy and bought it there. Amazon is getting bad on actually getting you the order overnight.  I had to wait 3 days to cancel the order because it sat in some warehouse.  Then it took 10 days for them to credit my card. An item that cost $1000 and is never delivered, should be refunded right away.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
AmazonCustomer,2/4/2024,"I've always bought the cheaper Samsung A series Android tablets and they've always disappointed in the long run. The S9 is just so responsive and quick at everything it does that I think it's worth the higher price. The OLED screen is excellent overall and it's just a joy to use.I tried to go the iPad route to see what all the hype was about and bought the base model 9th gen about a year ago. It was a pretty good tablet with a nice screen and decent speed, but the Apple ecosystem just wasn't for me. The S9 is better at everything and doesn't have big black bars on the sides of your videos due to Apple's unique display ratio. The 120Hz screen on the S9 is amazing. It made my iPad feel terrible to use when I went back to it for a comparison.I think most of all I missed the Google discover news feed (swipe left when on home screen). Apple news is a paid thing for most of the content and I found myself using my android phone to get my my news feed vs. my Apple tablet. The Google news app on iPad just wasn't the same. One thing I really did like about the iPad was the gestures. Turns out that android has pretty much identical gestures in the display options  and it's the best of both worlds for me on the s9 now. Don't think I'll have to upgrade for quite a while with how powerful this S9 is!",5,Galaxy Tab S9
MD,9/6/2023,"I bought this to replace a similar Galaxy Tab S4.  Nothing wrong with the older tablet, just was ready to upgrade- five years of use and not a single problem with it!  Anyway, there is almost no question the Tab S is the best Android tablet. The LED screens are just fantastic.  This new model is even faster yet.  0.5"" bigger screen (11"" instead of 10.5"") and almost the same size and weight.I got in on the deal that increased the memory and doubled the storage for no extra charge, so an astounding 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage- both way more than I will ever need.  S-pen works very well.  Sound is great (for a tablet).  Love the new in-screen fingerprint sensor.  Micro SD card slot works perfectly.The only thing I hate is that there is no headphone jack.  Almost didn't buy it for that reason, alone.  I hate using adapters/dongles.  And to use a dongle means I have to pry out the magnetic USB charger connector I love, every time, which is very difficult to do and I will likely lose it because it is so small.  There is ZERO reason to not include a headphone jack.  There is plenty of space, and they make jacks that are just as water-resistant as the USB port.  OK, I will stop with that rant.Oh, the price is crazy too.  Most people simply will not spend this much on a tablet, opting for something like the ""A"" line instead.  This model was $200 MORE than the crazy high price of my old S4, but the screen on the ""S"" is just so nice, so I just gotta have it :)",5,Galaxy Tab S9

The pictures are crisp and the speakers are great. The S pen that comes with it is a great feature and I'm glad it comes with the tablet and isn't an add on accessory. I got the base model which is similarly sized to my S6 because it was what I could afford.  I'd like to get the bigger model (plus or ultra) but they are just cost prohibitive.  The S series still has an expandable micro SD card slot, which I use.  I'm a die hard android user, so after months of consideration, finally caved.  Gave my daughter the S6 and now we are both happy.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

I wanted something portable that I could use as a computer to access my files online, work with my photos in Lightroom, and take notes or draw. I ultimately decided to go with the Tab S9 because of Samsung's strong reputation in electronics, their integration with Windows, and the DEX feature.I'm not disappointed, as the Tab S9 meets all my expectations. I’ve started bringing it to work for productivity and note-taking is fun now that my handwriting can be converted to text. However, Android software is not Windows, and trying to replicate my PC experience on the tablet has encountered some roadblocks. Fortunately, there is always a workaround.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
Steve T,4/3/2024,"This replaced my Samsung Tab S2 (a 2016 purchase).  The best part is the rich audio, absolutely stunning (and louder than the S2 I had been using).  Thankfully my phone charger also charges this tablet, the chargers are no longer included in the box.  There is no instruction booklet either, but you can view it on the phone or download it from the Samsung web site.  The Pen is a new toy for me, and it will be a while before I learn all it can do.  The product I purchased connects by means of WiFi 6 which is fast, my old Tab was WiFi or an added component on my wireless service of my phone carrier - I found that WiFi use only is totally sufficient in our world today compared to 2016.  If I get half as many years as my Tab S2 then the cost is well worth it - though I tend to stretch use out as long as I can.",5,Galaxy Tab S9

S. McCallister,3/30/2024,"This is my third Samsung Android tablet, with my previous one being the Galaxy Tab 7.  This is obviously newer, but it's also larger, nearly as large a screen as a 13"" laptop.  The screen and build quality are wonderful... and the extra real estate allows for even more immersive movies and gaming.  But bigger also means more bulky and heavy to travel with, especially if you also need to be carrying a laptop.  My wife uses her tablet as her primary device, and she loves this tablet.  I appreciate it, but when I go for a long trip later this year it will be interesting to see how I feel about its bulk.  Again, no technical complaints about this device, but I do think you need to consider how it will fit into your life and travels.

Richard Henriquez,5/23/2024,I love this for work and for relaxing at home the audio is as great as you can expect from a tablet and the screen size is very big although sometimes I wonder if the largest size would have been more enjoyable this plus size is definitely more portable and universally more comfortable to have,5,Galaxy Tab S9

Toil & Trouble,10/6/2023,"This has to be the best tablet I've ever used. It's lightning fast, and I've yet to find a program that doesn't run smooth as silk on this device.It's size might be a drawback for those who want small lightweight tablets, but with the performance you get out of this device those are minor considerations at best.Screen is sharp and bright. I actually had to reduce the brightness setting by a hefty amount to be comfortable for my eyes, and the built in speakers are sufficient that you really don't need to pair them to an external sound system to enjoy listening to music.If it continues to operate this well over time I will be a Samsung Galaxy tablet customer for life.You've got a great product here Samsung, don't mess it up by ""fixing"" it until it's broke.",5,Galaxy Tab S9
JJ,5/20/2024,This tablet is very powerful. Has some amazing (albeit scary) AI tools and surpasses all my expectations for a tablet. Can't for the life of me figure out what I'll ever need a PC for now!Screen is a 12.out of 10. Battery is good for all day and the next! It's a solid piece of hardware..,5,Galaxy Tab S9

Ankur Desai,11/5/2023,"This tablet is a true ipad killer.  All the speed when booting up and opening apps.  The pen is fun, but we don't use it much.  I had to buy a case since it is super slippery.  Takes away from the killer design and look, but better safe than sorry.Battery life seems to be solid assuming I'm not running live nest.ring cams in the background, otherwise you'll kill the battery in about 5-7 hours. Regular use should last you all day and then some.What can I say...Samsung finally caught up to apple.  I also own the Galaxy S23 Ultra phone and that already blows away the iphone.  RIP Steve Jobs...  your company was not left in good hands...",5,Galaxy Tab S9
