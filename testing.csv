galaxy s21 fe,overall like the phone it definitely missing basic feature like headphone jack that enjoyed on my samsung galaxy a52 that being said the thing with samsung phone is that the battery could be twice this size and it ll only last a long a the average time of other brand samsung ha horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware you can uninstall them and some you can remove notification or stop from running in general really like the camera and the screen you can get the spec that this phone ha for the sale price it doe have smaller camera but it about the software and the sensor being used here can have phone with 100 megapixels and still lack the detail that this phone provides it why turned down similar motorola nokia tcl and other branded phone also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at truthfully lg phone blew these samsung phone out of the water but hype and brand popularity kept samsung chugging along while real competition got removed so now m stuck using this phone until another company come along but it is good phone so no worry there you just won have good battery life also samsung phone are notoriously slow charger my 5yr old phone charge faster than this thing m talking about older than 2010 speed definitely buy fast charger it needed just to get average speed,4,Recommend

galaxy tab s10,the samsung galaxy tab s10 wa released on october 3 2024 the tablet us ai with feature like sketch to image and note assist this is high tech device and on the cutting edge of technology and new feature per the website here are some of the relevant feature memoryexternal memory microsd capacitymicrosd up to 1 5tb connectivitywi fi802 11a g ac ax 2 4ghz 5ghz 6ghz he160 mimo 1024 qamusbusb 3 2 gen 1bluetoothbluetooth v5 3bluetooth profilesa2dp avrcp di hid hogp opp pan pbp tmaplocation technologygps glonass beidou galileo qzssearjackusb type coverall the device work great find it to be very fast and very intuitive to use admittedly always wonder how much more technology can be put into tablet like device to distinguish themselves but this device is really nice what like best is the pen that come with device which make drawing and other element easy to use the device itself look great and well made got the grey color and it is very nice recommend getting case or cover to protect the device because find the case to be bit slippery the response time is very good so far and the batter life is excellent of course the device is new so expect the battery to be fresh and long lasting the display is excellent and crystal clear overall recommend this device if you want to focus on android based system plan to update this review once have more time with it but my impression so far is that it is great and well worth the investment recommended,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,i didn think d ever be able to afford new galaxy series and if my old galaxy 51 hadn died wouldn have spent the money to buy new phone but it completely died after 2 1 2 year and could not be repaired so had to however at 399 00 cyber monday special wa able to get this 1 model back 21 for what d have spent on comparable series and two major thing the series feature that the doesn is that it support wireless charging and smart watch connectivity it also ha much better camera and m sure ll find other great feature a go along the color isn a ugly a wa afraid it would be you can actually put tinted clear case on it and make it little more pretty or completely cover it with solid case it doesn come with any extra like galaxy used to in the past like manual case wall plug car plug or screen protecter nothing except shortish cord and tool to pop out the sim card slot which is on the side my service carrier is government lifeline company which run on the mobile network so just put my old sim card in my new phone and it wa connected instantly with the same phone number provider but did have to go through all the google setup which would have been way easier if my old phone had not been dead but got all of my contact back though without their photo d put with their name and lost all the photo from my dead phone got most of my apps back but did have to reinstall few and log into most again in order to use them galaxy stopped making the body casing openable few year ago so battery can be replaced easily and to try to get them repaired tech ha to melt the side of the case open which turned out really ugly when tried to get my 51 charging port replaced which didn save my old phone anyway and it looked like smeared crap after they melted it back together fyi this is very desirable phone despite the new attempt to make it more throwaway hopefully it will last me at least 3 or 4 year that would be 100 year plus interest it sad how much thing cost so much today,5,Recommend

t205bt,amazing earphone best have ever had,5,Recommend
galaxy tab s10,writing this review from the perspective of first time android user setup pretty much consists of agreeing to bunch of term never read and attuning the device to both google and samsung account for the former there are various privacy opt out such a non personal ad and whatnot for the latter you really kinda need to have that google account do anything useful and the samsung account is necessary for the ai stuff and various other feature like device tracking could skip the creation of samsung account but eventually gave in in order to engage with the other feature screen quality is amazing think it look a good or perhaps slightly better with web browsing and text clarity than my ipad seems easy enough to wipe the smudge clean pen is quite precise but still want to use my finger ve never used pen before so don have handle on all the gesture but the tracking is spot on and ll rarely have to re do any motion writing with it is smooth there no friction and the handwriting detection is pretty great at getting the word right but the odd uppercase letter show up where it shouldn oh and the pen can magnetically anchor to both the top and the rear of the device have noticed repeated alert about the pen not being synced but it never stop functioning so don know what that all about ui is where could probably nit pick bunch of stuff and have feeling that it mostly due to my familiarity with apple ui but thing like how whenever go to enter text field the on screen keyboard doesn automatically appear can write into the field with the pen but the field is small now don know if this is something can change in setting it just stood out a something odd ai hmmm well everyone is all about ai these day but it seems to me the hype exceeds the reality sketch to image is highly amusing and fast too must have spent almost an hour drawing cat and various other simple figure the recognition is scary precise because have absolutely zero illustration skill and yet the ai converted my scribble into exactly what had intended beyond that the circle to search is neat but it one of those tool just remember is there to use and then there are various other way in which the ai is integrated but it seems to me certain thing are going to be more for the power user than the casual,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,this is literally everything could ever want or need in phone do not give two crap about multiple camera or 90hz screen the pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it low price point double the storage than my last phone better camera better screen fantastic o update for three year free google photo storage and all for 50 less than my previous phone the camera is the selling point for me it is just a good a the camera on flagship phone and it only one camera google software really seriously kick as the touch screen is snappy and don find myself wishing it wa faster it responds immediately to touch scroll fast and look vibrant the screen to body ratio is perfect really great job removing bezel the hole punch is not at all irritating ve had the phone about three week now and am completely used to it it blend in and work well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpaper to suit it it is much better than notch of bezel it look cool think the base storage being 128gbs is seriously nut my last phone only got 64gbs because in order to get the 128gb version it wa 100 more with 128gbs and free google storage can imagine needing more space ever really m really enjoying the phone it nice to hold even with case it lightweight and pleasant to view and type on don imagine myself getting another phone for at least 5 year it is an absolute powerhouse of buy highly recommend,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s10,my first android tablet after many ipads finally ventured into an android tab in part because trust and am familiar with samsung since all my phone are android samsung and yes series immediately felt at home and had certain familiarity setup wa super super easy through their software quick switch which also support io and other android product within 30min everything wa copied but you can manually filter ie not all picture or video or other setting and the only thing left wa to sign in for the first time into the various apps syncing google store apps is also great there is nothing so far that disappoints but many item extra you don necessarily get yet with apple their much advertised free ai integration being probably the biggest but also their included matching pen that wa new to me still learning but liking it for sure smooth and responsive also included are multitude of extra software at least free for 6 month to try geared towards ai integration and pen support clipstudio lumafusion goodnotes to name few overall just great product but possibly would opt for the s10 not plus 11 version next time just tad too big to just grab for on the go gaming included don need that big of screen for that overall great technology first to offer multitude of working ai integration co e with integrated pen and software and support google and android freedom all boil down to are you an android or io fan if the former this is definitely you go to powerhouse can go wrong with 7 year support and separate removable storage expansion slot instead of paying for internal storage 5 star my rate scale 5 perfect 4 minor imperfection 3 on fence not sure if d buy again 2 too many problem 1 shouldn be sold or is dangerous,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,the two great thing about the pixel are it price point and camera everything else including proper camera control wa forgotten the main issue is the screen sensitivity have medium sized hand and finger size 9 10 and am quite adept at typing but felt like wa losing my mind and motor skill trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at it tallest and least cluttered setting tried typing the same sentence on different device and would have 4x the amount of error on that keyboard it doe help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection most of the new feature and control advertised are either novelty poorly implemented or downright dysfunctional the gesture control are chaotic basically making the entire edge of the screen very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it trying to scroll down through long article nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app want to pas the phone to someone to show them photo nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they ll wonder what you were trying to show them so switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait they put button for live transcription right next to the square overview button so there have been many occasion that unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing walk through the wood or me muttering to myself while editing or programming use lot of google home device and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world google like your saying voldemort in some rowling novel or else you get cursed with the assistant trying to search for or make music selection based off of snippet of your completely unrelated conversation finally that lovely little camera ha the worst most non intuitive control have ever used on phone sure you can get some great astrophotography shot but you have to turn on night sight mode and hope that the camera detects star or something to trigger the mode yes you can shoot astrophotography unless the phone think that is what you want try fighting phone control in the late evening in 20 degree yosemite park and you ll wish you had dslr with actual button so you can keep your glove on touch screen glove are thin and don work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issue switching between camera mode requires swipe and then some have popup so to go from portrait mode to slow mo you have to carefully swipe over couple icon and then touch one of the option that appears above video all with very temperamental screen it is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shot also have feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by google a they are already releasing thing for the 5 and 5g model that aren available for this one then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing feature a well for now am going back to my old phone very unsupported cracked and dull lg g6 and now being both burnt out from the new pixel android mobile and the io option may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying smart phone and go for simpler approach,1,Not Recommend

galaxy buds 3 pro ai,first off the sound quality is much better than the bud 2 pro which wa using before think the new control system of pinch and slide is better than bud 2 in the sense that you won accidentally hit pause by touching them like with bud 2 but you ll also find it tougher to get the touch control to register your input my main issue though is the ear tip they only give 3 size and in my case none of them fit really like having that seal on my ear and can not achieve this at all this wa still an issue with bud 2 but less so and in that case aftermarket foam tip fixed the issue a of my writing this there are no manufactured aftermarket foam tip available though there are some vendor on etsy who make them and so ll try those for reference have the biggest non custom u hat size 8 but the biggest tip are too big and the medium tip are way too small additionally the airpod style shape prevents me from being able to push the earbuds deeper into my ear overall they re great if they fit you but will require modification if they do not don understand why samsung is copying apple with this,4,Recommend

iphone 13,thing to remember before you buy an iphone 1 it is good only untill it warranty is there for extended warranty it is 10k approx for one year 2 under warranty also it resell value is only 25k in apple store so this itself explains that the mobile is over priced and that why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it actual value 3 once the warranty expires apple will keep on bringing in updated version and the updated version will mall function in 1 year old iphone a well problem include green screen network issue etc 4 many people iphones underwent green screen after the latest update and a their iphone wa not under warranty had to spend 400 or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change meaning apple company will release update because of which the iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it 5 iphone cover tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design even after spending 1500 to 2000 inr for an iphone cover it will last only for 6 8 month after that either it will become dull dirty or look ugly or pale an android cover of 250 r also function the same way 6 apps that is total scam everyone know that you have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in app storemoral of the story you can buy an expensive iphone and use it comfortable for year or maximum 2 so if you are ready to spend so much money just for year it is the best mobile for long run this is just scam that it will last for long run joke of the year you will be prompted with feature that iphone and macbook only have the only issue is comman man never us those feature so people inorder to prove that this is very unique feature unnecessarily use it show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an iphone kudos to them for doing something alien,1,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,so have had zero issue with the fingerprint reader it is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in even put case on mine and can still reach the finger reader so actually think it really great it much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one what like about this phone too is that it is thinner used to have the moto charge and that wa definitely much wider and didn realize how much more uncomfortable it is now when pick that one up to try and compare to this one it such beast in such tank whereas this new phone it thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if m holding it like cut which is very nice and can reach everything on it with my thumb the fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size a my old phone just no longer have big phone because it didn take up the whole screen it had side on it before so really like that this one is the whole screen and that it slimmer have nice case on it and have screen protector on the front and m still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine my only thing is yes the battery doe last all day my old phone my battery could last couple day but it wa an ex charge and the battery wa supposed to do that but the bonus about this phone here is it doe tell me if keep continuing using it at the rate that am it tell me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery so that easy for me to be like oh okay well m going to be going and doing this so maybe should charge it now but typically only charge it at night when m going to sleep it doe have spam detection for call which didn realize wa thing and ve had couple phone call like pop up but never ring and then they go away and am notified that they were spam and then have verified and they actually are indeed spam so that ha been really nice also like that can give name to my group chat everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what m used to it did take little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there wa no back button couldn figure it out but if you just hold off to the side little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between thing ve found my screen now ha five icon across compared to my old one that had only four icon across so for me that fine because can see them fine haven looked to see if can change that so if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be benefit but otherwise for me since don have that problem this is great really also like that can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pull up my calendar or the weather don have to go search for different app just click on it on my phone and it just take me to that app my other favorite thing is that it is still an android phone absolutely love the android app even have my tablet in android because m just so used to android and prefer android over the counterpart like really dislike apple and apple think is so much more expensive another fun thing is the night mode set bedtime for me and when it my bedtime if m staying up it go into black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then go all right fine yep it bedtime also like the do not disturb because can have thing blocked for when m sleeping so my phone isn ringing or anything and don have to remember to put it on silent it wa automatically doe that unless of course it emergency it is set to if somebody call back within 10 15 minute window that it will ring because it a priority call and have that turned on haven even come close to using all the storage space that have on my phone whereas my old phone wa constantly having to delete thing to get new app if wanted to and it wa very hard to do so like the extra space like how fast it work and like the thinness of it actually a for phone call and stuff don have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely i still get really nice picture this one doe say that it for all carrier and have xfinity mobile and when got the phone checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn i wa very frustrated even set up to start new return with this but then wa on with the people on chat and wa trying to figure it out and even said wa going to try and go somewhere else but here the thing even though that they wouldn help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service have very cheap bill with them just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it just think it like 12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since don use data don have bill each month because my phone is paid off have nothing else going on there so have really great deal with them so want to keep with them so so before decided to actually ship it back pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka my phone actually work really well didn have to change anything with my carrier all had to do wa change my sim card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it not compatible so would say give that try if you do have xfinity and then if it work great if not m sorry you ll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn work but mine work and ve been doing it for two month now and haven had any disruption with my service everything ha been great and haven had to change my billing at all so have really enjoyed having this phone hope my review ha been helpful if it ha been helpful please hit the helpful button,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s9,i ve always bought the cheaper samsung series android tablet and they ve always disappointed in the long run the s9 is just so responsive and quick at everything it doe that think it worth the higher price the oled screen is excellent overall and it just joy to use tried to go the ipad route to see what all the hype wa about and bought the base model 9th gen about year ago it wa pretty good tablet with nice screen and decent speed but the apple ecosystem just wasn for me the s9 is better at everything and doesn have big black bar on the side of your video due to apple unique display ratio the 120hz screen on the s9 is amazing it made my ipad feel terrible to use when went back to it for comparison think most of all missed the google discover news feed swipe left when on home screen apple news is paid thing for most of the content and found myself using my android phone to get my my news feed v my apple tablet the google news app on ipad just wasn the same one thing really did like about the ipad wa the gesture turn out that android ha pretty much identical gesture in the display option and it the best of both world for me on the s9 now don think ll have to upgrade for quite while with how powerful this s9 is,5,Recommend

tab m9,i recently purchased lenovo tablet and wanted to share my experience with it first and foremost want to clarify that my review is not directed at the seller they did their job in delivering the product promptly it important to note that seller have no control over the product itself decided on lenovo tablet because wa in need of device for both personal and work use and lenovo ha reputation for producing quality pc and laptop carefully examined the product spec on the lenovo website which indicated that the tablet had 32gb of storage expandable to 128gb with micro sd card however when the tablet arrived and went through the standard setup process including adding my google account and performing necessary update wa shocked to discover that only had 17gb of storage space remaining this wa before even installing the apps had planned to use inserted micro sd card and attempted to set it a expandable storage on top of the internal storage but to my disappointment the option wa nowhere to be found in the setting after some research on the lenovo website learned that the storage expansion feature had been removed in the latest system update rendering the micro sd card usable only for photo storage this left me frustrated a it nearly impossible to work with only 17gb of available storage on tablet the operating system and update had already consumed nearly half of the 32gb the tablet originally came with consequently promptly requested refund and opted to purchase samsung galaxy tab with 128gb of storage in conclusion if you re in the market for tablet would strongly advise against considering this lenovo tablet the unexpected removal of the storage expansion feature wa major disappointment and the limited storage capacity severely hindered it usability for my need,1,Not Recommend

galaxy s24+,my return window expired on 11 19 and this is jan 23 so am stuck have had multiple samsung phone and have always been very happy with them this one is much worse than my previous s9 which wa 6 year old the major issue is the fingerprint scanner have both fingerprint two separate finger and face recognition activated and still have to try multiple time 90 of the time even with multiple attempt nothing work 60 of the time and must put in my pin it is so bad that am close to moving to apple and hate learning new system without functional reason would go back to my old phone except the battery life had become very short and the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone wa seriously scratched but it still worked much better than my s24 my other issue with the phone are minor and would rate 4 star review those minor issue are the size which is little bigger than is comfortable the fingerprint scanner being on the front screen rather than the back of the phone which requires two hand to unlock and an iniblility to activate the google messaging which samsung now recommends lastly samsung keyboard now ha the microphone icon on the far bottom right corner of the screen which often cause new app to open rather than the voice recognition screen this later issue seems to be getting better for the apps use frequently but not other apps am guessing that the apps remember what my normal usage requires still it is poorly designed keyboard layout and samsung doesn permit using any other am going to call samsung support to see if they can ameliorate any of these issue before look for another phone they have been excellent in resolving issue on my prior phone but were unable to help me with activating the recommended google messaging on this one if am able to resolve any of the significant issue will modify this review accordingly,1,Not Recommend

iphone 13,so let me start out by saying that am not one to purchased refurbished phone and whenever something would happen to one of mine and had to turn it into the phone company and they would send me refurbished one to replace mine there wa always something wrong with them so that ha always made me little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation with that said a full time caregiver for the last 11 year have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phone that used to get back in the day many of my parent doctor do some video visit and some of them actually prefer facetime so a result having an iphone wa actually partly necessity for that reason have always been an android girl still have that too so didn quite know what iphone needed to get but after some research finally settled on what thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price a well a the warranty had actually considered either an iphone 11 or an iphone 13 a my choice a we are now on the 15 found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two after researching many different site some very reputable and actually recommended by people decided to land on amazon renewed program because ve always had nice experience when there have been any issue with product and ve never had any problem with customer service they ve always been very helpful and thought if anything were to happen with the phone would be hoping to have the same type of experience in looking at the option chose to actually pay more to have one that wa put forth by amazon themselves because they offered year warranty a opposed to many of the others who were bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 day or so etc and hey so far so good the phone arrived it wa in perfect cosmetic condition and have not had any issue with it since the battery wa at 87 and although would ve liked to had it higher than that wa glad to see that it still wa pretty snappy when needed it to be so would say that have been very pleased so far and would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested but can only speak to the actual product provided by amazon itself however m sure many of the third party individual that sell refurbished item may have some really good product themselves ah there go again refurbished renewed to may toe to mah toe well you get the jist,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s9+,originally bought this tablet with the intent to use it for gaming ultimately found that there is so much more you can get out of it than that it very thin lightweight tablet the screen is an impressive size that felt larger in my hand than had expected wa originally considering going for the ultra but the size of the s9 is more than enough for what need actually feel more comfortable using this tablet without the protective case that purchased for it when at home didn even bother putting on the protective glass screen bought for it because don see myself abusing this tablet a hard a abuse my phone the performance is fantastic this ha no problem playing whatever game you might want to play on it and the refresh rate is superb a someone who regularly us high refresh rate monitor can appreciate seeing similar performance on tablet what wasn expecting when bought this wa how much could get out of samsung second screen app this built in application allows you to wirelessly connect your samsung tablet to your pc and use it a an additional monitor a someone who regularly us laptop for work it game changing asset to have the integration is seamless you can even choose to enable the touchscreen so that you could browse through document like you would with kindle without having to go through the hassle of doing file transfer however with performance come price it go without saying that these tablet are pretty damn expensive if had to make recommendation would suggest settling for the s9 which my friend bought and is more than satisfied with most of what you are getting out of making the jump to the s9 or ultra is larger screen size visit your local electronics store and see which one is right for you,5,Recommend

watch ultra,i bought my watch in black friday 2022 just couple month after being diagnosed with sleep apnea after spending most of that year thinking wa dying because wa so tired wanted to track my sleep and decided to get the apple watch se the cheapest option that is almost perfect a sleep tracker device but when saw the ultra wa hooked ended up buying it and it ha been great purchase am tracking my activity and have become more active thanks to it have been able to correlate sleep quality with certain practice improving my sleep drastically and with it my overall health and this can not be understated how doe it help well being reminded all the time about your activity level brings level of awareness that without tracker you simply dont have and it is one of those thing in place helping you fight what is now and will be in the year to come the top killer and cause of pain and suffering in humanity sedentary lifestyle have kept incorporating good practice to my life and even when still dont have many physical result to show still overweight many facet of my life have improved the watch didnt do that directly but am constantly reminded of the need to take action and keep improving even it measure of vo2 max the best predictor of sudden death and longevity there is is something that will be help in the tough process of changing bad habit and creating new one the apple watch could be one of the best roi investment you can make if it happens to be an important tool in creating change in people a think it ha been to me now the look am big guy 6 3 and 320 pound the watch doesnt look massive on me a it doe to many people but doesnt look tiny a other alternative like it look on me battery life is awesome one of the reason why never bought an apple watch before wa because dont feel like charging watch every day and more than once day the almost 3 day battery life wa huge deciding factor to me also got 25 cash back with my credit card the battery is still rocking almost 18 month later understand most function in the watch are available with cheaper model of the apple watch but you dont get the rugged and nice look and the battery life just those two thing make me recommend the ultra to anyone looking for watch and tool that will no doubt help you improve your health if you are decided to do it,5,Recommend

galaxy buds 3 pro ai,i will admit that these are the first high end ear bud for me to buy and try out ve gone through many cheaper one but decided to try out something more have samsung galaxy ultra s23 phone to pair this with thing like sound quality is amazing can pick out individual note good bass can hear people talk and can hear from different angle think it a good a my higher end over ear headphone for the pc the noise canceling is really good remove maybe 80 of other noise leaving only very slight hum great when trying to zone out with thing going on around you easily connects and switch between phone pc and other device stay in your ear when exercising had bought an over the ear attachment thinking this would fall out while running exercising but it stay put and never needed it good fit inside ear even ha test to fit in the app took bit to get use too but control make it easy to use by hand pause next track go back volume up or down mic work wellnegatives battery life is good but could be better have now and then run into one side draining faster than the other use of noise canceling drain it much faster prob getting 70 80 of advertised time guessing at it might get more rubber ear attachment medium is good fit but wondering if need medium small wish it came with more than small medium and large attachment wish it came with tool to clean it but got 5 one and work great just scraper felt marker like thing ear wax build up very compared to others but think it is worth it if these hold up have read on reddit some user having issue,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,may 7 2021 thought on pixel 4a ordered november 8 2020 and used daily ever since pro form factor and weight this is the best marriage have found fantastic screen real estate sensible ideal resolution and just terrific dimension for me this thing is light weight for it size and love that more than can possibly express hand fatigue ha been all but completely eliminated give me plastic baby have no desire for metal that don add to functionality and apparently from something saw on youtube this phone is insanely rugged even with plastic shell glass is always heavier and less durable than other material choice and it just altogether not well suited for the backside of mobile handset imo think apple charge 550 to replace the back glass on most modern iphones this pixel 4a is the total package and sticker for 200 less than the price of apple back glass repair price performance while can compare this phone to another of it kind with higher performing qualcomm am never wanting for speed this phone ha been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day to day need the lean android experience on the pixel line really let it mid range qualcomm shine most recently carried both an iphone 7 plus and 2020 se and both proved plenty fast for anything do this 4a is no exception background app refreshes seem to be on par with what had using 3gb iphones no real surprise my day to day habit seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes ve noticed think the 6gb of memory strike good balance for the 4a don game well play some chess now and again including occasional analysis using very demanding engine stockfish etc but in general can comment on gaming performance battery battery life and charging time have been lovely seldom charge to 100 percent instead prefer to just give little 5 to 15 minute charge periodically during the day while keeping the battery in the 30 to 70 percent range where possible this thing charge way way faster than my older 7 plus and 2020 se iphones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what can gather very unscientifically leave it to the reader to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own camera it so good it doesn even make sense shooting still the 4a smash my old iphone 7 plus my wide margin and the 2020 se couldn hold candle either think that being objective ve had quite bit of low level professional photography training at university level and time behind the lens of dslrs and m quite astonishing that can get such quality image from the 4a the software image processing is pure magic have kid and they re the important subject for me d guessed the 4a might struggle with motion particularly in lower light which would have been deal breaker for me but this thing take keeper practically every single time glorious most already know how well pixel phone shoot non moving subject so won carry on about that it an exciting camera experience concerning video the 1080p 30 and 60 frame shooting ha not disappointed either and the image stabilization is truly excellent don mess with 4k on phone yet so no comment there don take selfies so won comment on the front facing camera either android the gesture navigation is fantastic particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left or right hand side of the display massively convenient and easy on the hand update security patch are crucial for me and with pixel scorching fast update are what you get and support duration best most android based oems fingerprint recognition work a well and a fast a any ve experienced thought the rear placement would bug me it absolutely doe not rear placement is probably my preference now well executed like con audio volume intensity the 4a just doesn get a loud a some other modern handset it tricky to listen to podcast or whatever when m doing dish for example that said the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory to me google search there a google search bar installed by default on the home screen leave mine there and find it useful when tapped you re presented with the ability to search apps web and more much like the search on io when you pull down from the top google android learns over time so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you re most likely to want work great more often than not but the problem for me is that it inconsistent with regard to displaying apps it must be that about 20 percent of the time it doesn display apps so m forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface then tap the google search bar again before it populates apps in the query can figure out what cause this for the life of me and ve owned an it msp for year so this ain my first rodeo with tech device frustrating but muscle memory make this only half second affair to correct dependability ve long used the same mvno for cell service which mention only because there exists small possibility that it of importance here ve found few occasion where can place phone call to fix for some reason reboot wa required haven had any issue in the past few month but it probably because ve changed habit now whenever there an update to something low level from android not just basic app update reboot the phone an ounce of prevention is worth pound of cure anyway d have need to reboot an iphone maybe once every six month outside of forced reboots from doing an io update to have had to monthly or maybe even more frequently reboot this 4a in order to connect phone call with no warning a to any trouble unless attempted to place call and connect the dot is unfortunate don like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time oled m sensitive to flicker so basically hate oled my daily driver laptop is thinkpad t480s largely because it 1080p ip is flicker free no pwm this 4a give me viewing fatigue after relatively short while on the 4a unless you re at max brightness exactly 100 percent you can expect flicker in the 122 to 255hz range that too low for me would prefer an lcd like the one had in my iphone 7 plus or 2020 se could view those endlessly without fatigue read book on them you name it but the industry doe trend and trend it doe for the contrast ratio spec and inky black the kid rave about these day roll eye overall this is probably the finest overall set of compromise ve ever found in cell phone and ve owned many of them since 1994 m highly satisfied with this handset and think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the pixel 4a google ha made proper phone for adult 9 10 do recommend,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,i coming from samsung android note 9 loved my note 9 but turn out m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phone who woulda thought my whole back of my note 9 phone wa shattered and the screen wa cracked and had an otterbox on it the entire time had the thing long story short bought the phone out after 2 year to switch service and when went to switch they took my case off to switch sim card and it wa shattered mess which wa highly disappointed about because thought it wa in good shape could have gotten it fixed for around 400 or could get different phone didn want nothing hella expensive m tired of having to pay extra for phone payment and then just breaking them because obviously m just not good with phone wanted something budget friendly with good quality camera but still similar to android system ve been team android forever now just really don care for their picture quality though have tried iphone out a well had the iphone and it just wasn for me however did love the picture quality so since ve tried both io and android and have certain thing like and disliked for both of them figured it wa time to give pixel try pro this phone is cute little and light weight phone but like not so little that the screen no good the screen to phone ratio is super nice and make the phone feel smaller with good sized screen which is what wanted wa over having huge heavy bulky phone have little hand and constantly wa dropping my bigger phone picture quality is awesome it def beat android and think it might even beat iphones easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one the back plastic which that wa what wa looking for people complain that oh it so boring looking with the plain black plastic back don get it so youd rather have pretty glass back that you end up covering with bulky case cause that make so much sense like how you can either have the navigation button or you can use the swipe control like this so your not stuck with one or the other battery life pretty good the charge seems to last me a long a my note 9 did it def seems very durable do have screen protector along with case on this phone not even good case or screen protector just something cheap grabbed ve dropped the phone few time now and no have had no issue volume is also pretty good con my biggest pet peeve with this phone isssss hate the way screen shot are on this phone okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shot which is normal for screen shot but on this phone the volume button and the power button are on the same side which make it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stay there which is annoying don like how there not a much customization a android would have such a changing the theme and stuff which sorta disappoints me conclusion all in all the pixel 4a really is not bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass thousand dollar phone would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixel this one wa mostly to try it out and see if even like them before getting one of the more expensive one later down the road nice thing about pixel even there higher end phone such a the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang android and iphones are if your looking for nice budget phone you won go wrong getting this one would recommend,4,Recommend

pixel 4a,i love this phone please keep in mind ve never owned flagship phone usually sticking to phone could buy outright for less than 200 that said wa ready for new phone and did lot of research also had chance to spend some time with pixel 4 to compare it so the following are my impression first off what different from the pixel 4 you are missing the aluminum frame the facial recognition the edge squeeze the water resistance specific camera lens and some camera feature wireless charging and an 800 series processor think that about it the thing is other than the water resistance personally don miss any of that what you get in return is slightly bigger screen better battery and brighter screen you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work this is also fair bit lighter also personal preference is that prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition for me it the perfect little phone full disclosure paid about 260 since bought it from amazon warehouse nonetheless this phone hit all the right spot for me it is light it ha clear and bright screen it is fast take amazing picture it isn bloated with preinstalled apps and is future proof in that you can update for 3 year the sound is pretty great and honestly can find much to complain about the only thing wish this had wa the water resistance accident happen also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated guerilla 3 screen buy case buy screen protector if you do can see why this phone won be great phone for you unless you only buy the 1000 flagship with all the bell and whistle in which case why are you even reading this review one last thought the battery is fine by me can make it through the day and longer with moderate use no wireless charging but it charge from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour so always find time within the day to plug it in and then m good to go usually at dinner time or whatever when don want to be disturbed anyway had chance to to go with the pixel 4 chose to go with this instead mostly because the pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim thanks google for this amazing cheap phone,5,Recommend

galaxy buds 3 pro ai,these are terrific earbuds m coming from pair of airpods pro 2nd gen which really like main reason for replacing is that ve gotten tired of not being able to change certain setting since m not an apple user these sound great just a good a apple if not better d say the anc is about the same which both do great job in that department the fit like all earbuds can be hit or miss depending on person ear they come with 3 size found the largest one to fit snugly in my ear most of the negative review that ve read are from people who weren able to find tip that fit their ear if they don fit snugly sound quality and anc won be very good so fit is critical wear these mostly for sleeping tried several top brand and none were comfortable when sleeping which is why landed on the airpods about year ago these are very similar they might extend out just slightly more but work very good for sleeping like my airpods the big advantage to these is that can turn off anc and ambient mode to save battery life the airpods could not turn mode off because don own an iphone this result in longer battery life and get me through the night in summary would definitely recommend these my son bought pair of silver bud and have the one in white we are both very pleased with sound quality anc and the different setting that you can select one thing would recommend if you get these is to adjust the eq once did the sound is pretty amazing,5,Recommend

iphone 13,this is my first iphone and it always feel good to hold this masterpiece this look premium not just because of it branding it ha everything which make it feel premium however despite all the look and finish the transition from android to apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain feature that can make life easy wa using samsung s10 lite before this and still have that phone with me putting out the feature that is being missed by me 1 forwarding anything in whatsapp forwarding anything in whatsapp from iphone take bit more step a compared to what is being offered in android this make the entire process slow for an android user2 app switcher apple could have easily made app switcher easy with just light swipe up instead they made it with long pressed swipe up why man why you don have any feature for swipe up just make it easy to launch 3 andorid dialer is always missed every android ha basic feature where you can search the contact directly from phone dialer here dialer is used for dialing number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contact or last dial this is really bad if you have to dial number directly use dialer if you have to dial someone from recent call log shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact shift to that man all this can be done under one button under dialer android user will miss this very badly 4 sending multiple file in whatsapp if you want to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp you have to do it twice in android one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select a many file a they want and can send in single click here for sending multiple file you have to go to gallery or folder and select all file first and share it through whatsapp 5 no swipe based shifting from chat to status and to call in android whatsapp you can switch between call chat and status by just swiping here you have to press button of each 6 contact viewing contact list sorting method is still out of my mind man make it easy for example if one of your contact first name or middle name or last name any one of thing start with alphabet than it will be shown on top of the list apple pls adopt any one method or at least allow u to customise it 7 many apps in android are much more refined than it version on apple 8 this is for those who had use samsung pay samsung pay wa one of the best app for making upi or card payment just swipe up from home screen of samsung phone only series and the app is open for payment miss that here very badly 9 lack of dual messenger facility you can use two different whatsapp number here in the same phone a supported in all android right now these are the issue that face right now apart from this the phone is good the sound is loud and clear it feel premium in hand the touch is very good and face id work like charm gesture control customization is really good and you can customize lot of thing,4,Recommend

galaxy tab s10,i not sure how can sell anyone on this by now most people know what they want from tablet and know that samsung almost always delivers if you re an apple user this isn likely for you not because of any missing or unusual feature but because it run android there a big adjustment if you switch from apple ecosystem to android so if you re thinking about doing so prepare yourself for quite the learning curve now onto the tablet the screen is brilliant absolutely breathtaking quality the touch sensitivity is perfect with and without using the pen the glossy finish make everything look so crisp in term of speed this is lightning fast tablet ve had zero issue with lag or performance and despite the performance being so good it still get amazing battery life what most impressive about the battery life is the standby time went away and left my tablet home and unplugged over week later it wa still going even keeping up with notification find that to be very impressive for connectivity had no issue wi fi setup wa breeze and bluetooth device pair with no problem find folding keyboard is very useful for tablet a it greatly increase productivity when using the tablet for more office centric purpose storage capacity is plentiful even overkill 512 gb go long way with tablet don do much in the way of taking photo or video with it a find tablet too bulky to enjoy photography with so in that regard the storage is substantial overkill when you don plan to take photo or video with it but if you do you ll still be fine for good while overall this is top tier tablet it very pricey but you get lot for that price one very annoying thing though is that like apple samsung ha decided to take away the power charging brick from the box at over thousand buck that just super annoying this should be provided a charging over usb without it is much slower,5,Recommend

 iphone 13 -refurb,the problem with refurbished product is the appearance and especially the battery in the first place user consider replacing their battery when it is around 80 so no one want to buy one with the same 80 battery the lifespan of an iphone is considered to be between 80 0 and 100 20 within the range of 20 if it arrives at 80 it can not be said to be refurbished even when buying or reselling used iphones except for new one they have maximum charge of 70 80 therefore the way to distinguish between bad and good dealer is mostly determined by the scratch on the exterior and the battery capacity incidentally the usage time at 70 is around 4 hour 70 to 100 time with maximum load 80 usage time is around 6 hour maximum charging time generally recommended for replacing 90 usage time is more than 9 hour 100 usage time is more than 11 hour those that do not last half day are likely to cause stress wa debating between the 13 and the 14 and bought the 13 and it wa the right decision the price had come down quite bit so thought there might be difference but the performance wa exactly the same the only difference wa whether the number of core wa one more or one less and there wa almost no difference in term of operation there are probably only darker and lighter color variation but it doesn seem like an upgrade the operation is sluggish on both the 13 and 14 and it feel like scrolling screen movement doesn slide had the xsmax before and it wa smooth when scrolling screen movement so it a bit disappointing,2,Not Recommend

ipad air 13-inch m2,while the device itself may be ok the process of setup and transferring data from another device is an exercise in hair pulling rage inducing frustration apple seems to delight in writing software that go into funky state that can take hour to return without any user feedback or ability to interrupt during the setup process it force an o update 18 to 18 1 which spends 20 minute in preparing update with no feedback or estimated completion time if you aren babysitting it it then stop and doe not install the update until you return and press the update button even though you already did that before the update itself seems to hang and never complete eventually gave up and rebooted the ipad which did manage to bypass the update then it go into data transfer mode and never provides an estimate completion time just sits forever on estimating a career software developer m dismayed and appalled at apple software quality update found the only way to accomplish the transfer wa to 1 do full local not icloud backup of my old ipad in itunes on my pc 2 set up the new ipad a new device 3 update the new ipad to the latest io 18 1 and 4 restore from the backup using itunes this worked flawlessly and quickly with no hang or extremely long pause stuck on updating or estimating,2,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,i ve had my phone couple of month it replaced moto droid turbo 2 which wa great phone chose the 4a in part because it a smaller unit don want cigar box in my pocket the compromise wa on how narrow it is bit too narrow less screen not a substantial in the hand but those are tradeoff nice to have clean android install and update pro comfortable size good display responsive and smooth action battery life is excellent get 2 3 day but watch little video play no game keep location off unless need it camera ha pretty good night mode don use wrapper on my phone it slide in out of pocket easier bare dropped it once no damage finger crossed don use face recog or fingerprint reader great price con bit too narrow display is not a good a the review would have you believe ditto on the camera m not very happy with it the control are clumsy including the exposure hotspot really miss the turbo 2 wave your hand to see notification seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phone screen is slow to populate when booting it probably android or the app not the phone but it often play the wrong ringtones on the alarm the only other phone considered seriously looked at lot in person is the samsung s21 not 5g at higher price if were to do it again might be swayed to get that instead the camera is just better a is the screen but ll be honest 349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat unless your phone is really big deal to you the 4a doe the job nicely one last thing ll never buy another locked phone again,4,Recommend
galaxy tab a9+,i got the 128 model on the amazon sale few day ago the only reason bought it wa for traveling because did not want to drag around my 2022 ipad air and possibly lose or mess up 500 00 tablet so like the headline state it ok for the price not the retail price but the sale price last year bought the fire 11 for the same reason travel but ended up returning it after few day due to price drop and amazon refusing to offer price match discount along those line tried my best and spoke to numerous people over an 8 month period but amazon refused to return or credit the 70 or so received from trading in two cheaper amazon tablet when bought the 11 have been informed over and over again by customer service you lose the trade in on return now can not find this anywhere in the trade in policy but there it is so be forewarned would say both the tablet are very similar with slight edge maybe to the samsung with the 8gb v 4gb on the fire neither are a smooth a the air but that is where the price difference come in when bought this believe the fire wa 199 and the a9 wa 209 for an additional 4gb of memory 10 buck is good for me plus had no more available trade in for the 20 discount a for the tablet itself the sound is fine picture is fine and really prefer google apps a they just seem to have more of what want imagine build quality is similar now for the apps prime video wa loaded along with peacock disney mgm hbo max paramount all my streaming service with one glaring if not unexpected exception apple tv found an itunes app but no tv app maybe the fire ha it don know also loaded samsung smartswitch which allowed me to sync info from my iphone no issue worked well although it did take minute using wireless connectivity the tablet did not come with plug a ha been noted many time guess you know is it big deal if you have other electronics no but if this wa your only one mean really is that plug really saving all that much money off the list price some of these thing the corporation do nowadays just seem silly greedy a far a charging go this seemed to be another hot topic so using an apple 20w fast charger the tablet went from 13 to 100 in about 2 1 2 hour if went usb only would guess more than double that time would be required did make sure fast charge wa on in the tablet it shipped that way the battery did seem to wear down rather quickly but not fast enough to return the tablet the phone transfer wa about 30 minute and all did other than that wa load apps and change some setting for few hour this took me from 50 to 13 how that compare to my air no idea but it is acceptable one thing do not like and maybe just need to try bit harder can not figure out how to get auto blocker turned on it right there in setting but greyed out a is two other advanced setting below it just keep seeing spiral up top right like something is trying to load only thing can figure out is if you have free apps loaded you can not block the pop ups or whatever wi fi hooked up right away so did not bother trying my phone hot spot other than that see no issue with this tablet at the right price of course,4,Recommend

pixel 4a,i had the pixel 3a xl prior to ordering this phone but my wife needed better phone so ordered this one and gave her my 3a xl a she wanted the larger size my biggest concern wa the screen size difference but with the slim bezel on the 4a the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a xl you can see slight difference when you hold them side to side but in practical term of use it very neglible a for the phone itself love it it ha the awesome camera have come to love with the pixel lineup the fingerprint reader is still in place it ha more memory and ram than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a xl wa while do have very large hand the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle and much easier to operate one handed prior to my pixel 3a xl had the huawei mate 10 pro which absolutely loved have also had nexus and galaxy phone a well a few other more budget friendly phone for the money this phone is an absolute slam dunk everything you need nothing you don full transparency am not gamer so can not attest to how it hold up in heavy gaming but beyond that it work wonderfully if there is any downside it is the battery not that it small have gotten through all day on more than one occasion however with my slightly more than average use do find myself needing to top off late in the evening the good news is that in a little a 15 min this thing will charge up 50 or more so it not huge deal if you are going to go out for the evening just plug it up while you are getting ready and you ll be more than good to go they claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone battery life over time so we ll see how that go but despite that it is still phone would recommend all day long especially when comparing to other phone in this price point oh and having just one color choice what doe that really matter especially when virtually all of u put some sort of case on the phone there a good variety of case to add color so don let that stop you,5,Recommend

in-ear wired headphone,partiamo dal presupposto che ovviamente non cercavo la qualit delle bose ma trovo che quelli di amazon si sono impegnati per realizzare un paio di cuffie sbagliate sotto co tante cose iniziamo il microfono sul latto opposto sinistro rispetto come siamo abituati noi italiani sinceramente non un difetto di per ma lo per un italiano abituato tenerlo destra il microfono posizionato troppo in basso questo un classico delle cuffie scadenti anche la ludo lo fa le cuffie hanno delle casse pessime non parlo di come riproducono bass alti ma che spesso si sente poco nulla gli auricolari sono incredibilmente scomodi il prezzo per una qualit del genere altissimo preferisco spendere 30 euro prendere le cuffie samsung originali non compratele su amazon che vengono venduti solo falsi qui oppure spendo 8 euro compro le cuffie samsung false su amazon che per quanto non siano originali almeno dovrebbero fare il loro sporco lavoro credo conclusione pessimo acquisto,1,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,honestly love this phone it quite the step up from the galaxy j7 had before the fingerprint scanner is so good ve never had issue with it being able to read my fingerprint the next thing love about this phone is the camera the camera is amazing it able to zoom in really nicely and even ha night time mode where it is able to capture more light which make dark picture much more vibrant the screen is very scratch resistant a well and even tho the phone is made out of plastic havent had any issue with body damage even tho have dropped it once or twice but that probably bcuz keep it in case the only thing that wa bit disappointed by wa the battery life which is not a good a my last phone and run down quickly when have the brightness up too high but havent had super big issue with running out of battery life before the end of the day think this phone is really good deal for it price point totally worth it,5,Recommend
galaxy s21 fe,bought the 256gb version when it wa on sale for 599 on amazon which wa very good buy overall it a decent flagship phone some may say lower tier flagship which could understand performance is alright but it android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again camera is good not great but pixel 6 is better love the many many feature that samsung that this device come with such a bixby routine game changer samsung dex secure folder good lock ram plus customizable always on display edge panel link to window for synchronization with window computer smart widget stacking multiple interactive widget together that can rotate video call effect with apps such a duo a duo whatsapp m team zoom the screen recorder actually capture the audio from zoom or google meet etc battery life is good enough once you don use 120hz all the time bixby routine can help with that this phone will get 4 year of o update and 5 year of security update so that really great for longevity wouldn recommend it for 699 but if you see it on sale for much less you certainly will on amazon then go for it,4,Recommend

galaxy buds 3 pro ai,that my biggest critic of these earbuds the design miss the small clean bud that the pro2 and previous had to offer now they stick out in strange way that look like they re trying to emulate apple but give off knock off feel though with bigger bud come more room for bigger spec m not knowledgeable enough to know how to use the number of the spec to describe how it effect listening and the microphone but know for fact there a huge difference between these and the pro2 the pro2 mic for example used to be horrid when trying to talk with friend over the phone the first thing did when got the pro3 wa call my friend to test them usually they could tell when wa wearing the earbuds because the mic wa so bad but this time around they couldn even tell until had mentioned it there also big difference in sound both hardware and software wise when first putting on the earbuds and adjusting them could tell the bud were trying to turn on small amount of noise canceling without the setting being on to adjust to the fit the sound hardware wise is much fuller this time around and can hear sample or certain part of song that wasn able to hear before small consequence of this is the high hat tends to be bit too jarring for me but that nothing an equalizer can fix for now other than the design really liking the sound and mic will update if find more to include,4,Recommend

galaxy tab s9+,first off this tablet is great my recommendation is to price around once week and see the various color they offer it change when bought this one the beige wa cheaper than the black then the following week when my husband wanted one both of them where at the same price and few cent more expensive then what bought mine got this tablet to replace my laptop don get me wrong would rather be on my laptop but due to wrist injury can lift much without help or being in pain so this is why got it m samsung user in general so the setup wa easy for me everyone learning curve is different wifi is good but the downside it will try to connect to everything even the neighbor stuff changing and keeping the charge is fine but it drain quickly if m watching youtube or playing moblie game like honkai star rail think can get 4 hour of honkai without and be at 10,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s10,my first android tablet after many ipads finally ventured into an android tab in part because trust and am familiar with samsung since all my phone are android samsung and yes series immediately felt at home and had certain familiarity setup wa super super easy through their software quick switch which also support io and other android product within 30min everything wa copied but you can manually filter ie not all picture or video or other setting and the only thing left wa to sign in for the first time into the various apps syncing google store apps is also great there is nothing so far that disappoints but many item extra you don necessarily get yet with apple their much advertised free ai integration being probably the biggest but also their included matching pen that wa new to me still learning but liking it for sure smooth and responsive also included are multitude of extra software at least free for 6 month to try geared towards ai integration and pen support clipstudio lumafusion goodnotes to name few overall just great product but possibly would opt for the s10 not plus 11 version next time just tad too big to just grab for on the go gaming included don need that big of screen for that overall great technology first to offer multitude of working ai integration co e with integrated pen and software and support google and android freedom all boil down to are you an android or io fan if the former this is definitely you go to powerhouse can go wrong with 7 year support and separate removable storage expansion slot instead of paying for internal storage 5 star my rate scale 5 perfect 4 minor imperfection 3 on fence not sure if d buy again 2 too many problem 1 shouldn be sold or is dangerous,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,i have had my previous phone for long time and it just begun to go wonky know old phone create problem at disposal for our planet so have been holding onto the old one for many year in fact it wa my first mobile phone so switching to new phone for me is similar to buying 2015 car with computer and electronics v my 20 year old car with none expect will be using this for some time without having clue how to use all it feature so will just address the basic the power button is in horrible place and am forever hitting it so that suck it is thankfully silver so at least it is easy to see and the phone is motion activated so having the screen light up on pick up is feature can get used to fast screen resolution is huge improvement a are many basic just had my first spam call and wa delighted to have the option to reply with google spam filter and messaging that asks the caller to leave their id and message saw it in real time a text to confirm it wa caller looking to sell something the ring tone are nice too the message function kinda clunky system setting were difficult to find so much so eventually created desktop shortcut to access them the recorded audio quality sound muffled when set up my vm message and the camera which though would be exceptional oddly interprets some color use it to post pic of my painting to instagram and it couldn tell the difference between teal and blue battery life is good to transfer data between the new phone and the old wa pain because only after contacting tech support did find out the enclosed usb cable only work between pixel phone they really should include info like that with the cable instruction and alert you when you buy had to buy new cable for this one time use and wait until had it in hand before could transfer my contact list etc this phone cost me more than my dell desktop computer and large screen think it highway robbery what this and other even more expensive phone cost but it is what it is the position of the on switch exactly where you hold it really is lousy design that have to deal with every time pick it up,4,Recommend

ipad pro 13-inch m4,in contrast to my usual practice of upgrading my ipad pro two year later made an exception due to close friend borrowing my previous ipad pro model from 2021 unfortunately he dropped or let it fall off the couch resulting in cracked screen since wa out of warranty quickly realized that replacing the screen would be quite costly consequently decided to gift the ipad to my friend and purchase new one instead typically opt for the ipad pro with the highest memory and cellular data option however my carrier mobile wa only offering deal on an ipad at the time they would have applied the credit to any ipad product in the past but this time they refused therefore saved significant amount of money by purchasing the ipad from amazon which already take percentage off the top this wa the most favorable deal available for an apple product to further reduce expense opted for an ipad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity given that already subscribe to premium icloud service it made no sense to pay for the highest level of memory in summary made wise decision by purchasing the ipad at reasonable price the ipad itself feature several improvement including the m4 processor thinner design and upgraded camera overall am satisfied with my purchase while typically purchase my ipad pro through my carrier which come with subsidy am retired now and occasionally consider commuting and traveling however my travel frequency is limited and can easily connect to wi fi at home restaurant or other establishment logically wa able to save substantial amount of money by purchasing the premium apple product and opting for the ipad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity am very pleased with my decision although could have potentially saved even more money by purchasing the subsidized ipad nine would have ended up paying more due to the monthly fee in conclusion if you decide to purchase an ipad it is essential to get the magic keyboard case and the apple pencil pro a they complement the product and enhance it functionality,5,Recommend

iphone 13,this is my first iphone and it always feel good to hold this masterpiece this look premium not just because of it branding it ha everything which make it feel premium however despite all the look and finish the transition from android to apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain feature that can make life easy wa using vivo y19 lite before this and still have that phone with me putting out the feature that is being missed by me 1 forwarding anything in whatsapp forwarding anything in whatsapp from iphone take bit more step a compared to what is being offered in android this make the entire process slow for an android user2 app switcher apple could have easily made app switcher easy with just light swipe up instead they made it with long pressed swipe up why man why you don have any feature for swipe up just make it easy to launch 3 andorid dialer is always missed every android ha basic feature where you can search the contact directly from phone dialer here dialer is used for dialing number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contact or last dial this is really bad if you have to dial number directly use dialer if you have to dial someone from recent call log shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact shift to that man all this can be done under one button under dialer android user will miss this very badly 4 sending multiple file in whatsapp if you want to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp you have to do it twice in android one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select a many file a they want and can send in single click here for sending multiple file you have to go to gallery or folder and select all file first and share it through whatsapp 5 no swipe based shifting from chat to status and to call in android whatsapp you can switch between call chat and status by just swiping here you have to press button of each 6 contact viewing contact list sorting method is still out of my mind man make it easy for example if one of your contact first name or middle name or last name any one of thing start with alphabet than it will be shown on top of the list apple pls adopt any one method or at least allow u to customise it 7 many apps in android are much more refined than it version on apple 8 this is for those who had use samsung pay samsung pay wa one of the best app for making upi or card payment just swipe up from home screen of samsung phone only series and the app is open for payment miss that here very badly 9 lack of dual messenger facility you can use two different whatsapp number here in the same phone a supported in all android right now these are the issue that face right now apart from this the phone is good the sound is loud and clear it feel premium in hand the touch is very good and face id work like charm gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise lot of thing,5,Recommend

t10,edited originally loved these but after week use am finding that the right earbud occasionally doesn charge when it is placed into the charging hub the left one ha begun to crackle bit and sometimes it sound like they are echoing a in maybe the left earbud is lagging between the two use these to connect to my laptop for my college course so listening to lecture hearing them echo or crackle is frustrating generally do not take the time to write review but have now bought two set of these one for myself and one for my husband the sound quality is actually amazing and all for great price am very satisfied the battery life is decent overall good buy,2,Not Recommend
t10,i an audiophile and am impressed for how cheap they are they put out great sound if you really want to hear what they can do cup your hand over your ear and they sound sweet my only gripe is that they tend to fall out pretty easy how many time they have dropped is uncountable but did take shower with them in and they work great the water or soap can interfere with the function but they work that wa cool good battery life did the case great deal,4,Recommend

iphone 14,the apple iphone 14 is overall great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed excellent camera quality and day long of battery life the squared off side are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion purchased this one and so far my experience ha been wonderful something like about this phone is it fast speed along with the different option the camera give you wouldn say the iphone 14 ha better camera than the 13 rather think they are more similar and there wasn a dramatic improvement the battery life is something that wish wa little longer it last about an hour or two more than the average iphone 13 but doe charge faster have been able to receive about 50 charge in 30 minute another great feature of this phone is the painless esim setup being able to set up the sim card virtually and not physical transfer on your phone make carrying over carrier from phone to phone much easier battery last a long a the iphone 13 a you may remember it wa much better than the iphone 12 the iphone 14 is smooth responsive phone and great for high quality gaming or photo and video editing overall think this is great phone to purchase if you are looking for durable and sustainable upgrade and do think it is worth the extra hundred dollar from the 13,5,Recommend

galaxy tab a9+,i got the 128 model on the amazon sale few day ago the only reason bought it wa for traveling because did not want to drag around my 2022 ipad air and possibly lose or mess up 500 00 tablet so like the headline state it ok for the price not the retail price but the sale price last year bought the fire 11 for the same reason travel but ended up returning it after few day due to price drop and amazon refusing to offer price match discount along those line tried my best and spoke to numerous people over an 8 month period but amazon refused to return or credit the 70 or so received from trading in two cheaper amazon tablet when bought the 11 have been informed over and over again by customer service you lose the trade in on return now can not find this anywhere in the trade in policy but there it is so be forewarned would say both the tablet are very similar with slight edge maybe to the samsung with the 8gb v 4gb on the fire neither are a smooth a the air but that is where the price difference come in when bought this believe the fire wa 199 and the a9 wa 209 for an additional 4gb of memory 10 buck is good for me plus had no more available trade in for the 20 discount a for the tablet itself the sound is fine picture is fine and really prefer google apps a they just seem to have more of what want imagine build quality is similar now for the apps prime video wa loaded along with peacock disney mgm hbo max paramount all my streaming service with one glaring if not unexpected exception apple tv found an itunes app but no tv app maybe the fire ha it don know also loaded samsung smartswitch which allowed me to sync info from my iphone no issue worked well although it did take minute using wireless connectivity the tablet did not come with plug a ha been noted many time guess you know is it big deal if you have other electronics no but if this wa your only one mean really is that plug really saving all that much money off the list price some of these thing the corporation do nowadays just seem silly greedy a far a charging go this seemed to be another hot topic so using an apple 20w fast charger the tablet went from 13 to 100 in about 2 1 2 hour if went usb only would guess more than double that time would be required did make sure fast charge wa on in the tablet it shipped that way the battery did seem to wear down rather quickly but not fast enough to return the tablet the phone transfer wa about 30 minute and all did other than that wa load apps and change some setting for few hour this took me from 50 to 13 how that compare to my air no idea but it is acceptable one thing do not like and maybe just need to try bit harder can not figure out how to get auto blocker turned on it right there in setting but greyed out a is two other advanced setting below it just keep seeing spiral up top right like something is trying to load only thing can figure out is if you have free apps loaded you can not block the pop ups or whatever wi fi hooked up right away so did not bother trying my phone hot spot other than that see no issue with this tablet at the right price of course,4,Recommend

galaxy s24,pleeeeease people stop complaining about the display and thing like that the display is just amazing by looking at the low rating of the item wa really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it pre ordered the s24 ultra in violet color 512gb version and want to note that everything wa fair a expected got the 512gb version at the price of 256gb one and also 200 amazon gift which is non redeemable gift that work a single time 200 to your purchase from amazon that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 month next about the device it really beautiful really love everything about it the size the flat screen the back cover and camera design wise this is beauty it ha lot of nice and fun feature to play with it my second day of usage and still have ai feature to test camera capability to check out etc and the pen this is my first ever samsung phone and really got used to it and to be honest it sometimes lot more comfortable to use the pen instead of your finger some thing in life are really designed to be accomplished with pen and paper this phone cover that need the sound and speaker are veeery loud mean my whole office can hear my incoming notification lol and the quality of music listening video watching etc really nice still have to find out all of the capability of the camera this is separate big topic but so far can confirm what lot of reviewer have already talked about the normal photo taking is great selfies look really amazing for front camera the zoom is fantastic with really good detail night mode result in bright a day photo although bit noisy and video shooting is also nice with different mod the o is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least mean you can connect the device to monitor mouse and keyboard via some 5 in 1 anker for example and here you just got yourself laptop with the size of phone oneui is really the most rich software ve used so far and before using it wa skeptical if d like it or not but m really getting used to it and the feature like multitasking in true desktop way on the phone this is something else not the dex just phone multi window usage that awesome the battery is nice maybe expected something more by viewing some review with almost 20 hour of screen time or so but really it fine for day of usage with qhd resolution adaptive brightness and app and ai usage during the whole day the only disadvantage want to mention are the price tag that is high let be honest and the box content mean why copy bad stuff from apple and not include at least small charging brick in the box this is really uncool especially within that price started with the display but want to finish talking about it a well it huge and really like it the corner are sharp ended but that give you the advantage of viewing non cropped out content the resolution the brightness refresh rate the display is killer really really don get the people that complain about the color or perform some test on the device etc no need overall m really happy with my purchase this is great phone can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiast like me and maybe to iphone user a well to come out of the box and see that there are other great phone out there in the world that can totally kill any iphone with all the feature and stuff you get,5,Recommend

iphone 13,this is my first iphone and it always feel good to hold this masterpiece this look premium not just because of it branding it ha everything which make it feel premium however despite all the look and finish the transition from android to apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain feature that can make life easy wa using samsung s10 lite before this and still have that phone with me putting out the feature that is being missed by me 1 forwarding anything in whatsapp forwarding anything in whatsapp from iphone take bit more step a compared to what is being offered in android this make the entire process slow for an android user2 app switcher apple could have easily made app switcher easy with just light swipe up instead they made it with long pressed swipe up why man why you don have any feature for swipe up just make it easy to launch 3 andorid dialer is always missed every android ha basic feature where you can search the contact directly from phone dialer here dialer is used for dialing number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contact or last dial this is really bad if you have to dial number directly use dialer if you have to dial someone from recent call log shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact shift to that man all this can be done under one button under dialer android user will miss this very badly 4 sending multiple file in whatsapp if you want to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp you have to do it twice in android one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select a many file a they want and can send in single click here for sending multiple file you have to go to gallery or folder and select all file first and share it through whatsapp 5 no swipe based shifting from chat to status and to call in android whatsapp you can switch between call chat and status by just swiping here you have to press button of each 6 contact viewing contact list sorting method is still out of my mind man make it easy for example if one of your contact first name or middle name or last name any one of thing start with alphabet than it will be shown on top of the list apple pls adopt any one method or at least allow u to customise it 7 many apps in android are much more refined than it version on apple 8 this is for those who had use samsung pay samsung pay wa one of the best app for making upi or card payment just swipe up from home screen of samsung phone only series and the app is open for payment miss that here very badly 9 lack of dual messenger facility you can use two different whatsapp number here in the same phone a supported in all android right now these are the issue that face right now apart from this the phone is good the sound is loud and clear it feel premium in hand the touch is very good and face id work like charm gesture control customization is really good and you can customize lot of thing,4,Recommend

watch ultra,this thing get really bright and last like 2 day the watch is very big and it ha this really cool action button and for myself who work at night at my job which is outdoors if ever am in place with no lighting can quickly just press the button and it will illuminate the entire room thanks to the insane amount of nit the screen can get to would say it ha good value for your money you get quality material and different type of band for this ocean band it is very uncomfortable and leaf groove line on your wrist even if you have it too tight but you know did get used to it but wish went with different band that wasn this silicone one just really liked the look of it and hate anything water it charge very fast and it come with braided charging cable but no block it very easy to use just like any apple watch ve had apple watch in the past series 3 and 5 and 7 and ve noticed that this one is significantly better with snappiness and efficiency not like it really matter because watch tell time regardless but if you re someone who doe lot of exercise or us your watch instead of phone then it always good to have that extra speed because you won be waiting a long for something like map to load this is very pretty watch but remember this thing wa built for the intention of adventure so it isn gon na look sleek like your typical apple watch or apple device such a the normal series this thing ha rugged edge the screen is the slightest bit lower then the watch itself with almost like wall around the screen to protect it from scratch work a server at restaurant which consider that an adventure this watch ha been hit by cup probably drowned ice thrown at it maybe some sort of mystery sauce on it no clue but it still look great and it ha few scratch because of it rugged and adventurous look the scratch add character to it,5,Recommend

tab m9,there is lot to like about this tablet it nearly the perfect size to use a reader and for general entertainment it feel solid and is suitably fast for general infotainment function some reviewer have even reported being able to use it for light gaming would not expect it to perform a well for multitasking productivity type functionality this wa going to be my go to recommendation for anyone looking for an inexpensive but functional tablet for the next year or two wa also ready to get one for family member who is not especially tech savvy when out of the blue the tablet offered an android 13 upgrade wow so soon after procuring this tablet nice well a it turn out lenovo implementation of android 13 on this device includes completely pointless taskbar this taskbar is great at getting in the way and provides little additional value when you are using this tablet a tablet it might have some use if you were using this tablet for productivity device but this is not tablet that is especially fit for productivity apps this taskbar severely impedes using navigation button and can not be hidden when using them so if you want the taskbar out of the way you must use the default launcher and set navigation for gesture only once this is done may you use third party launcher you can then swipe down to make the taskbar disappear it will reappear after restarting the tablet or after unlocking then this workaround must be done again other manufacturer allow user to disable the taskbar in the interface lenovo android 13 implementation for this tablet doe not allow this am hoping this option becomes available in future update but until then can recommend this tablet for anyone who might easily be confused by this new feature and it a regular annoyance for me too it too bad because otherwise this is very nice tablet for the price point ll circle back and note if this issue get resolved with future update,2,Not Recommend

iphone 13,thing to remember before you buy an iphone 1 it is good only untill it warranty is there for extended warranty it is 10k approx for one year 2 under warranty also it resell value is only 25k in apple store so this itself explains that the mobile is over priced and that why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it actual value 3 once the warranty expires apple will keep on bringing in updated version and the updated version will mall function in 1 year old iphone a well problem include green screen network issue etc 4 many people iphones underwent green screen after the latest update and a their iphone wa not under warranty had to spend 400 or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change meaning apple company will release update because of which the iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it 5 iphone cover tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design even after spending 1500 to 2000 inr for an iphone cover it will last only for 6 8 month after that either it will become dull dirty or look ugly or pale an android cover of 250 r also function the same way 6 apps that is total scam everyone know that you have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in app storemoral of the story you can buy an expensive iphone and use it comfortable for year or maximum 2 so if you are ready to spend so much money just for year it is the best mobile for long run this is just scam that it will last for long run joke of the year you will be prompted with feature that iphone and macbook only have the only issue is comman man never us those feature so people inorder to prove that this is very unique feature unnecessarily use it show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an iphone kudos to them for doing something alien,1,Not Recommend

iphone 12,for starter the price on these phone is great between having the reassurance of amazon buyer protection and the benefit of knowing the device ha been tested for performance it well worth it needed new phone fast after my cat knocked mine into the sink rice fixed it for while but it wa only temporary before it died altogether hate buying phone and avoid it whenever possible 99 of mine belonged to someone in my family first and wa good with that needless to say my cat didn wait for someone in my family to upgrade wa on my own this time okay that not entirely true my grandma had an iphone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime going from an iphone 11 pro max to an iphone 7 wa bad it wa too dam small in every possible way 32 gig of memory needed an upgrade fast my 11 year old wa bullying me relentlessly and that on me they had my old xr formerly my dad i scoured fb marketplace d decided upgrade little so could feel better about the switch didn want to feel backed me into corner by my cat recklessness would get slightly newer model in fun colour marketplace had plenty sending message after message from my iphone 7 worried this person seems too eager this one ha been posted so long want purple but the only purple one listed ha less storage space and the pretty green one ha small crack this guy life 2 hour from me and battery life errr last time checked it wa like 74 no can take screenshot of it it turned off cash only please etc so much pressure what happens if the thing doesn work that 300 down the drain knew couldn afford new but hated the idea of buying something used from stranger on facebook didn want to get scammed and also didn want to settle that when remembered good ol amazon maybe d check there just for funsies probably out of my budget but it couldn hurt sure enough refurbished device selling like new mostly same cost or less than what d found so far surely there wa catch read through everything tested by amazon includes all the spec unlocked can pick the colour the storage size the condition etc and could have it delivered to me tomorrow with warranty recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12 don come in yellow then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender the lavender would take an extra day to arrive mint it wa a promised it arrived the next day it wa in beautiful shape 128g mint green not single scratch 86 battery life all for less than would have paid to some stranger for 64g with some small scratch once my case and screen protector arrived excitedly set it up and synced my data oh no the face id didnt work after becoming used to facial recognition having that yanked away and dealing with 7 for over 2 week wa desperate for the convenience of face id had been using my fingerprint like caveman not to mention have blink 182 ticket and it specifically state facial recognition is required to access the mobile ticket idk if that true but needed face id googled contacted apple support fixing it could be upwards of 300 that almost what paid for the whole phone realllllly didn want to be stuck without phone again but also wanted one fully functioning so reached out to amazon support and explained the rep wa incredibly helpful a most amazon rep are and after bts failed she advised the ship wa 3rd party seller and she send message to them if they don fix it by insert date contact u back and we ll make this right she encouraged m ngl wa nervous didn have high hope having dealt with 3p seller on amazon in the past at least amazon had my back ig the concert wasn till july even without facial recognition it wa load better than the 7 could make do in the meantime the seller came in clutch though and my worry wa unwarranted they responded within minute they were receptive apologetic and more than willing to help a d anticipated they offered refund or exchange a soon a they received the return explained my concern with not having phone for several day or more and the merchant offered to overnight replacement a soon a the return wa dropped off could deal with one day without phone gratefully accepted that wa saturday night we made plan to catch up monday for the return instruction and for them to overnight it monday reached back out and they were ready to ship but they had no more green shock do you have purple no just blue white and black this wa huge bummer it silly know and the definition of first world problem but mean my change of heart about this whole phone thing hinged on the fun colour without it wa just person out 350 because my cat wa thirsty while wa watching youtube while washing dish needed cool colour plus d already gotten the matching case clear with mint green border it wasn even fun blue it wa dark serious navy blue it wa pretty and classy but wanted something fun even asked if he had any older model in yellow no luck they told me they be restocking in day or so still no green or purple came in ugh reality wa setting in wa going to have to settle it wa fine thought at least it would be fully functioning phone no wasn ready to let go they assured me could take my time to decide and asked if we could wait another week in case one came in if it didn then would choose from the option available messaged them wednesday afternoon bracing myself for the answer they got in purple yay they sent label dropped it off sent photo and had my new phone the next morning they said overnight shipping but wow d dropped off the return around 3pm and had the replacement by noon the next day didn even have my new case yet despite the barney esque colour scheme my mint green case created the lavender is gorgeous and m actually sort of glad the green didn work out don get me wrong the green is also gorgeous but in the end m glad ended up with the lavender wa overjoyed when wa prompted to set face id during setup worked brilliantly a did everything else great packaging no cosmetic flaw amazing battery life customer service wa great and best of all it purple can wait to pair it with the new case m so glad went this route where have some peace of mind a buyer m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me a insufferable a must have seemed making such fuss over colour preferenceif you re nervous buying phone used or refurbished too hopefully you can take comfort in knowing this seller is legit you receive good quality product and speaking from experience they ll gladly help resolve any issue you may run into,5,Recommend

iphone 13,we re pretty confident when we say that the iphone 13 is the best iphone for most people it may look like apple ha only changed the position of one of the phone back camera since last year model but trust u when we say that there are more substantial upgrade than that with new display larger battery and better camera hardware and software the iphone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phone once again apple made the iphone 13 far more powerful than it android competitor thanks to it 5g ready a15 bionic chip if the raw performance doesn interest you photographer can play with the new photographic style filter in the camera app while videographers will be excited by the new cinematic mode focus racking ability the regular iphone 13 ha some flaw the charging is still relatively slow compared to some android phone and don like that only the iphone 13 pro model get 120hz display and telephoto zoom but based on my in depth iphone 13 review this new iphone is the best phone for the money the overall display quality continues to be stellar when watching the trailer for the matrix resurrection wa mesmerized by the neon code encircling neo a he walked down the street and in another scene could make out individual hair on neo beard a he stared up into the sun display1 smaller notch make the display bit more immersive2 slightly different button placement3 pink and blue are standout colors4 new green color launched march 2022camera1 bright and colorful image beat samsung2 ultra wide camera delivers more scene and improved night mode3 photographic style give you creative controlvideo1 cinematic mode automatically change focus on subject while adding bokeh2 superior dolby vision hdr video qualityperformance and a15 bionic1 a15 bionic is the fastest chip once again2 machine learning performance notably betterbattery life1 10 hour and 33 minute of battery life which is 2 hour better than the iphone 12software1 shareplay let you watch video and listen to music with friends2 focus cut down on distractionsverdict the iphone 13 improves on what wa already the best iphone for most people by introducing bunch of welcome enhancement especially like the longer battery life a the iphone 12 endurance wa underwhelming even for 5g phone wouldn recommend that iphone 12 owner upgrade to the new iphone but the iphone 13 is worth it if you own an iphone 11 or older device don think many people will care about the smaller notch what truly stand out on the iphone 13 is the camera the low light performance is even better now and computational photography feature like cinematic mode and photographic style flex the a15 bionic muscle in way that go way beyond benchmark m also glad apple doubled the starting storage at 128gb a that move wa overdue and put the new iphone on par with android flagship d like to see apple offering faster charging next time around be it via usb or magsafe a well a 120hz display the bottom line is that the iphone 13 is fantastic phone and raise the bar for what you think camera phone can do,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s9+,tablet and typically don get along especially on the android side of thing which is why my enthusiasm for this tablet ha really caught me by surprise ve owned few android tablet an ipad mini and little surface tablet and mostly these experience taught me that just maybe tablet aren for me always missed having cursor or having keyboard that wasn a case or most of all program on my desktop or even just my chromebook so kind of turned my back on tablet for while wa using my two in one samsung chromebook 2 a tablet but the myriad of issue that have recently cropped up on that device made me want to try an actual tablet again enter the s9 ve loved this thing from the moment unboxed it calling the color beige almost seems like an insult it a nice silvery white that really make the device stand out and the matching color of the pen is nice touch and the screen is absolutely gorgeous can stop admiring it whenever wake it up the color and brightness are really great and you can fine tune the latter for your need haven tried using it in full blast of sunlight yet but it excelled everywhere else portability is breeze since the s9 is so light even with the case have for it which add bit of heft it still much easier to carry around than my chromebook and the functionality have the samsung flip 5 and the samsung bud live and the s9 interface with both of them flawlessly can look at message from my phone and it also grabbed bunch of info from it saving me time and listen to both my tablet and my phone on my bud live among other thing gone are the day that need to pack separate headset earphone for my tablet and my phone it such stream lined setup love it this is ordinarily where would list all of my con but don have lot honestly my only dissatisfaction is how expensive the s9 samsung accessory are how much for the cover oof and how limited but maybe more will spring up in time used to dislike how limited apps were on android tablet but now you can get huge plethora of apps that connect to your destktop version it really just depends on what you use and how you work so yeah love this thing a you can tell ve written this review on it even if you need tablet spruce up in your life and you own some other samsung product recommend this one,5,Recommend

ipad 10th gen,warning read this first look for the asterisk in the text below read that area first before clicking on the buy button my ipad 9th generation ha served me well for the past few year but the battery life wa beginning to suffer and the screen had few scratch from daily use could have had the battery replaced but that seemed to average around 100 and that wa no go especially since wa offered just 90 on trade in so spending more just didn make sense now apple want 349 for the base 64gb unit but ve noticed that many store have reduced the price to 299 possibly because apple ha discontinued sale of the 9th generation and supply are starting to dry up so jumped at the chance to get newer version ve been good boy this year and saved my money so could afford this got mine in yellow since the better half ha hers in pink no confusing these two one thing you ll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimension are not much different from the earlier generation however look can be deceiving the screen go from 10 2 inch to 10 9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom and that begs the question how do close out apps without pressing that button the android way that how you slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them or choose the one you want to use those of you using iphones know this procedure well yet another question ve been asked where the fingerprint id if the button is gone it now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner d love to tell you that setup wa snap but d be lying this ipad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old ipad thought had dud called apple and they discovered this one wa lacking update from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing since my old ipad wa already on 18 1 it wa trying to force apps and setting to new ipad that couldn readily take it mind you apple verified this wa indeed brand new ipad and not refurb or customer return it had just been sitting around in warehouse for nearly 2 year so in short you ll have to do update first and then transfer from your old ipad and how do you do that sign in to your apple account instead of allowing transfer from your icloud or other ipad tell it you want to do thing manually at that point it ll do the update a required then you reset the ipad and start over however once the update are installed they stay forever now transferring from either the cloud or your open ipad should be breeze two hour breeze plan on plugging it in too you ll suck at least 30 of your battery doing just this procedure now back to the review overall operation are not drastically different from what could see however don use my ipad for heavy duty artistic work nor do play intense game for joe or jane everyday this ipad won present any significant performance change how about the screen look about the same to me battery life improved over my old tablet only because that battery wa on it way out but only time will tell if it is substantially better will give point to apple though for finally going to usb charger instead of the lightning variety wa getting tired of lugging different charger around now come the last question is this ipad worth the extra cost when you can still possibly find ipad 9 for 100 less yes and no yes if you can get this model for 299 at which point it just 50 more than the 9th generation come with bigger screen and us the readily accepted usb charger no if you have to pay full retail of 350 or so at that point you might want to live with the lightning charger and button at the bottom,4,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,the cpu is fast and the phone ha enough ram to the point where your phone doesn freeze up opening certain apps the storage space is generous and the sd card slot area is pretty dope a well it may seem inconvenient unless you re upgrading from an android phone that had back piece where you could take out the battery the camera shoot in 4k and allows you to focus on an object for those of you who don know what 4k is think 4k hd certain adult film company us camera of this quality lmao the price is reasonable especially for all the feature storage space ram and other spec that this phone ha the camera is on par with most newer iphones if not better it approximately a big a the iphone 13 pro max and faster ve tested this out personally the samsung fe series is quite refreshing experience it well worth the price oh another thing if you like decent headphone this phone sport newer version of bluetooth connectivity it will have better connection to wireless earbuds wireless headphone smart tv bluetooth speaker car that support bluetooth etc the color are of nice variety and the display is beautiful you can watch video in 4k quality it is also legit pro gamer phone no game ve played ha ever lagged the download speed is pretty impressive a well overall if you prefer samsung phone or great phone at reasonable price then d recommend this phone via amazon the best function is the bluetooth tethering you can share your phone wifi data with another device without it using your mobile hotspot data and without being charged you can even charge another qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off qi compatible device apologize for the rant lol also so far a of june 2022 this is the last high end samsung phone with micro sd card slot you also power off the phone differently you don need to hold the power button on the side of the device screenshots are also different you hold the power button and the volume down button at the same time for one second this phone can also block apple id these crazy female won be calling me from different phone number anymore at 3am in the morning,5,Recommend

tab m9,i replacing another older lenovo tablet with this one after breaking the screen on the other wa very happy with that tablet so thought this would be safe choice definitely mistake the tablet ha an infuriating problem with breaking browser window by reloading them if switch away to another app and come back this cause lot of problem if you have entered information previously or are using progressive web app there not enough memory on the device to handle keeping inactive apps in memory normally that an uncommon thing but with this tablet it happens every time m browsing make doing any kind of form submission just about impossible unless you never leave the window that dropped my rating from 4 star to 2 the other lost star wa battery life the form factor is nice the 9 inch screen is definitely good size for reading book the battery life isn great end up charging it daily to be sure have enough power for the next day and there is an annoying lenovo duraspeed app restrict application which appears to be watchdog to slow or lock background apps down if they use too much processor again this feel like kludge because the tablet is underpowered bottom line at this price you can do better it not worth the headache,2,Not Recommend
