pixel 4a,i love this phone please keep in mind ve never owned flagship phone usually sticking to phone could buy outright for less than 200 that said wa ready for new phone and did lot of research also had chance to spend some time with pixel 4 to compare it so the following are my impression first off what different from the pixel 4 you are missing the aluminum frame the facial recognition the edge squeeze the water resistance specific camera lens and some camera feature wireless charging and an 800 series processor think that about it the thing is other than the water resistance personally don miss any of that what you get in return is slightly bigger screen better battery and brighter screen you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work this is also fair bit lighter also personal preference is that prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition for me it the perfect little phone full disclosure paid about 260 since bought it from amazon warehouse nonetheless this phone hit all the right spot for me it is light it ha clear and bright screen it is fast take amazing picture it isn bloated with preinstalled apps and is future proof in that you can update for 3 year the sound is pretty great and honestly can find much to complain about the only thing wish this had wa the water resistance accident happen also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated guerilla 3 screen buy case buy screen protector if you do can see why this phone won be great phone for you unless you only buy the 1000 flagship with all the bell and whistle in which case why are you even reading this review one last thought the battery is fine by me can make it through the day and longer with moderate use no wireless charging but it charge from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour so always find time within the day to plug it in and then m good to go usually at dinner time or whatever when don want to be disturbed anyway had chance to to go with the pixel 4 chose to go with this instead mostly because the pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim thanks google for this amazing cheap phone,5,Recommend
galaxy watch 6,do not buy this watch the product work well but there is strong chance the battery will overheat and stop working the customer service admits this is common and they have you send it back for service have done this twice now in three month the customer service policy is horrible have been on the phone with them for many hour and have gotten zero satisfaction if could give them zero it would be 100 point too high,1,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,i coming from samsung android note 9 loved my note 9 but turn out m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phone who woulda thought my whole back of my note 9 phone wa shattered and the screen wa cracked and had an otterbox on it the entire time had the thing long story short bought the phone out after 2 year to switch service and when went to switch they took my case off to switch sim card and it wa shattered mess which wa highly disappointed about because thought it wa in good shape could have gotten it fixed for around 400 or could get different phone didn want nothing hella expensive m tired of having to pay extra for phone payment and then just breaking them because obviously m just not good with phone wanted something budget friendly with good quality camera but still similar to android system ve been team android forever now just really don care for their picture quality though have tried iphone out a well had the iphone and it just wasn for me however did love the picture quality so since ve tried both io and android and have certain thing like and disliked for both of them figured it wa time to give pixel try pro this phone is cute little and light weight phone but like not so little that the screen no good the screen to phone ratio is super nice and make the phone feel smaller with good sized screen which is what wanted wa over having huge heavy bulky phone have little hand and constantly wa dropping my bigger phone picture quality is awesome it def beat android and think it might even beat iphones easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one the back plastic which that wa what wa looking for people complain that oh it so boring looking with the plain black plastic back don get it so youd rather have pretty glass back that you end up covering with bulky case cause that make so much sense like how you can either have the navigation button or you can use the swipe control like this so your not stuck with one or the other battery life pretty good the charge seems to last me a long a my note 9 did it def seems very durable do have screen protector along with case on this phone not even good case or screen protector just something cheap grabbed ve dropped the phone few time now and no have had no issue volume is also pretty good con my biggest pet peeve with this phone isssss hate the way screen shot are on this phone okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shot which is normal for screen shot but on this phone the volume button and the power button are on the same side which make it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stay there which is annoying don like how there not a much customization a android would have such a changing the theme and stuff which sorta disappoints me conclusion all in all the pixel 4a really is not bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass thousand dollar phone would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixel this one wa mostly to try it out and see if even like them before getting one of the more expensive one later down the road nice thing about pixel even there higher end phone such a the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang android and iphones are if your looking for nice budget phone you won go wrong getting this one would recommend,4,Recommend

iphone 13,this is my first iphone and it always feel good to hold this masterpiece this look premium not just because of it branding it ha everything which make it feel premium however despite all the look and finish the transition from android to apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain feature that can make life easy wa using samsung s10 lite before this and still have that phone with me putting out the feature that is being missed by me 1 forwarding anything in whatsapp forwarding anything in whatsapp from iphone take bit more step a compared to what is being offered in android this make the entire process slow for an android user2 app switcher apple could have easily made app switcher easy with just light swipe up instead they made it with long pressed swipe up why man why you don have any feature for swipe up just make it easy to launch 3 andorid dialer is always missed every android ha basic feature where you can search the contact directly from phone dialer here dialer is used for dialing number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contact or last dial this is really bad if you have to dial number directly use dialer if you have to dial someone from recent call log shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact shift to that man all this can be done under one button under dialer android user will miss this very badly 4 sending multiple file in whatsapp if you want to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp you have to do it twice in android one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select a many file a they want and can send in single click here for sending multiple file you have to go to gallery or folder and select all file first and share it through whatsapp 5 no swipe based shifting from chat to status and to call in android whatsapp you can switch between call chat and status by just swiping here you have to press button of each 6 contact viewing contact list sorting method is still out of my mind man make it easy for example if one of your contact first name or middle name or last name any one of thing start with alphabet than it will be shown on top of the list apple pls adopt any one method or at least allow u to customise it 7 many apps in android are much more refined than it version on apple 8 this is for those who had use samsung pay samsung pay wa one of the best app for making upi or card payment just swipe up from home screen of samsung phone only series and the app is open for payment miss that here very badly 9 lack of dual messenger facility you can use two different whatsapp number here in the same phone a supported in all android right now these are the issue that face right now apart from this the phone is good the sound is loud and clear it feel premium in hand the touch is very good and face id work like charm gesture control customization is really good and you can customize lot of thing,4,Recommend

iphone 13,my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object have been using android phone since the last 10 year and finally decided to switch to iphone used to roast iphone for it price lack of feature and also thing like power adapter not given in box etc but my last android phone iqoo 7 legend had lot of software related issue and battery issue after updating it to android 12 tired of bug and software glitch in android finally decided to buy iphone and switch from android to io and boy wa right never even held an iphone in my life before because of it price but now made great choice even if had to spend all my saving on it iphone 13 is so smooth that even my iqoo 7 legend with 120hz feel slower than it even if iphone ha only 60hz and can believe what m seeing all the game apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android wa very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo had 66w fast charger where a for iphone had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs but charging speed isn disappointing display quality is truly flagship level and m quite fan of the small 6 1 display believe it or not being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful build quality is great would recommend not to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro because don think having extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k you can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iphone 13 wide angle camera struggle in low light but main camera is really good capture true colour front camera is really good too truly flagship speaker are great battery life is better than my previous device io is very optimised in term of battery life easy 8hrs sot on normal usage note while playing bgmi you loose around 2 battery every 6minutes at hd extreme graphic which is also good pro max would be far better in term of battery for the software yes feel like there are few downside even if the software is very smooth and ha very less bug it ha two annoying thing any game get paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc lock screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notification is also annoying clearing all notification is also very annoying but other than that perfect 10 10 purchase wa very disappointed at myself when paid for the iphone but when received it wa truly happy that bought it truly worth it,5,Recommend

iphone 13,thing to remember before you buy an iphone 1 it is good only untill it warranty is there for extended warranty it is 10k approx for one year 2 under warranty also it resell value is only 25k in apple store so this itself explains that the mobile is over priced and that why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it actual value 3 once the warranty expires apple will keep on bringing in updated version and the updated version will mall function in 1 year old iphone a well problem include green screen network issue etc 4 many people iphones underwent green screen after the latest update and a their iphone wa not under warranty had to spend 400 or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change meaning apple company will release update because of which the iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it 5 iphone cover tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design even after spending 1500 to 2000 inr for an iphone cover it will last only for 6 8 month after that either it will become dull dirty or look ugly or pale an android cover of 250 r also function the same way 6 apps that is total scam everyone know that you have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in app storemoral of the story you can buy an expensive iphone and use it comfortable for year or maximum 2 so if you are ready to spend so much money just for year it is the best mobile for long run this is just scam that it will last for long run joke of the year you will be prompted with feature that iphone and macbook only have the only issue is comman man never us those feature so people inorder to prove that this is very unique feature unnecessarily use it show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an iphone kudos to them for doing something alien,1,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,when dropped our old mobile phone service to move to project fi new compatible phone were necessary the pixel2 had just come out and wa my choice to replace my family phone the monthly phone bill wa very low compared to our old service and year worth of the saving paid for our phone after two year we upgraded to pixel 4xl set when need arose for an additional phone again researched available option ultimately choosing the pixel 4a admittedly wanted something less expensive than another 4xl plus size appropriate for smaller hand with good camera and no degradation in performance the 4a ha been perfect choice it smaller and easier to hold the camera seems to be the equal of it bigger counterpart much acclaimed camera not everyone love the feature but m partial to phone with fingerprint sensor on the back like on the 4a something else don see all the time on inexpensive phone is the ability to make contactless payment nfc old style headphone are compatible too with the 4a headphone jack at this price it wasn a surprise or very disappointing to learn that the phone isn rated a water resistant highly recommend google fi phone service and google pixel phone considering the saving compared to high end android phone the 4a is an intelligent choice for anyone that want most of the perk of the bigger set in less sexy package plastic versus glass five star,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,overall like the phone it definitely missing basic feature like headphone jack that enjoyed on my samsung galaxy a52 that being said the thing with samsung phone is that the battery could be twice this size and it ll only last a long a the average time of other brand samsung ha horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware you can uninstall them and some you can remove notification or stop from running in general really like the camera and the screen you can get the spec that this phone ha for the sale price it doe have smaller camera but it about the software and the sensor being used here can have phone with 100 megapixels and still lack the detail that this phone provides it why turned down similar motorola nokia tcl and other branded phone also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at truthfully lg phone blew these samsung phone out of the water but hype and brand popularity kept samsung chugging along while real competition got removed so now m stuck using this phone until another company come along but it is good phone so no worry there you just won have good battery life also samsung phone are notoriously slow charger my 5yr old phone charge faster than this thing m talking about older than 2010 speed definitely buy fast charger it needed just to get average speed,4,Recommend

galaxy s24 fe,i have samsung s23 ultra see the reflection of it used to take the picture that bought brand new upon release and ve never hated phone like the s23 ultra have the screen is too big and very unresponsive at the center of the screen while the edge are extremely responsive at slight touch of the palm of my small hand it also lagging compared to my s10 and the powerful camera is uselessly blurry because it take too long to ai which is supposed to help focus also find the phone battery to drain faster than my s10 and the wifi bluetooth connection cut off from time to time the s23 ultra brightness bar is also badly designed compared to the s10 you can slowly increase or decrease the brightness on the s23 ultra like it is on the s10 slight slide of the s23 ultra brightness bar increase or decrease the brightness too much making you waste time trying to find the right middle the same go when you want to move the cursor between character of text or sm on s23 ultra it jump from haracter1 to chara cter5 when all you wanted wa to move the cursor to cha racter3 it might be that my s23 ultra ha screen defect and should ve returned it but didn now bought this cheaper s24 fe and transferred all my data to it and swear to god m loving it the s24 fe small size is so good in my average man hand and the screen is very responsive with screen protector the 90 not round edge are good because my palm doesn touch the screen while m typing it also ha better camera focus and the brightness bar is not increasing or decreasing lot with slight slide like it is with the s23 ultra the wifi and bluetooth connection are also better on the s24 fe still can believe spent more than twice the price of this s24 fe when bought the s23 ultra and the s23 ultra doesn even have something special that like and use except the camera that can zoom 10x but is uselessly blurry 2 time out of 3 in summary everything on the s24 fe is to my taste better than the s23 ultra except the camera zoom which is 10x zoom on the s23 ultra and 3x zoom on the s24 fe update 12 09 24 while my s24 fe battery drain slower than my s23 ultra it fast charge is lot slower than the s23 ultra expected the way around because the s23 ultra ha bigger battery it might be because have too many apps on the s23 ultra which drain battery faster but it doesn make any sense to me that the s23 ultra that drain battery faster is also charging faster also dislike that samsung is forcing u to use the new 6 pin lock on new phone in order to get the option of unlocking your phone by typing your 6 digit pin without pressing the ok button on my s23 utra when type my pin code 1234 example of pin it unlocks on s24 fe have to typing 123456 to unlock it if you use pin code like 1234 on s24 fe you must also press ok to unlock small detail but very annoying if you re using your phone a an uber lyft driver where you need to keep your eye on busy road while typing longer pin code had to remove the pin because almost had an accident because m not used to 6 digit pin d rather get this cheap phone and data stolen than dying into an accident,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,i will say right off the bat this is probably the way will buy phone from here on out it is great deal cheaper and am happy with my purchase paid 218 for one year old flagship phone selected an excellent condition phone it came with glass screen protector which disrupted the amoled display so removed it and noticed couple of larger scratch that were imperceptible with the protector on this is not quite according to the description which is partially why have my review at 4 star the only other issue have had is battery life believe that this phone is running at about 80 battery health am very heavy user and so have to run the phone with battery saver activated to make it through full day but that isn that huge of deal samsung battery saver is relatively unobtrusive however may opt for higher quality renewed phone in the future overall am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this process to others,4,Recommend

galaxy tab s9+,i bought this to replace similar galaxy tab s4 nothing wrong with the older tablet just wa ready to upgrade five year of use and not single problem with it anyway there is almost no question the tab is the best android tablet the led screen are just fantastic this new model is even faster yet 0 5 bigger screen 11 instead of 10 5 and almost the same size and weight got in on the deal that increased the memory and doubled the storage for no extra charge so an astounding 12gb of memory and 256gb of storage both way more than will ever need pen work very well sound is great for tablet love the new in screen fingerprint sensor micro sd card slot work perfectly the only thing hate is that there is no headphone jack almost didn buy it for that reason alone hate using adapter dongle and to use dongle mean have to pry out the magnetic usb charger connector love every time which is very difficult to do and will likely lose it because it is so small there is zero reason to not include headphone jack there is plenty of space and they make jack that are just a water resistant a the usb port ok will stop with that rant oh the price is crazy too most people simply will not spend this much on tablet opting for something like the line instead this model wa 200 more than the crazy high price of my old s4 but the screen on the is just so nice so just got ta have it,5,Recommend

iphone 13,a am strapped for money decided to go the refurbished route in hope of saving few dollar since apple got rid of the monthly card installment for an unlocked phone when first opened the box noticed it wa in excellent physical condition almost perfect definitely had high hope for this phone from the get go unfortunately immediately started having issue once connected it it started freezing couldn access my setting or voicemail and my battery life wa already at 85 restarted the phone and it worked for about 30 minute before started having issue again while on the charger at about 90 charged it turned off on me twice while wa using it it didn automatically turn back on so had to turn it on again both time figured that wasn a huge problem and would contact amazon customer service in the morning if it did it again however started having more problem had to make quick trip to the store and thats when noticed that a soon a got in the car and wa no longer connected to wifi it immediately just went to no service would restart it and when it turned on it would work for about 3 5 minute but then would go back to no service fortunately knew where wa if not definitely would have been lost at night after got home restarted couple more time but it wouldn connect to my cellular data anymore or work all unless wa connected to wifi a stated previously had high hope unfortunately look like got defective phone but can risk or deal with the chance of getting another refurbished phone with problem so decided to go and ahead and return the phone literally had to run to to best buy 15 minute before they closed to buy new phone because unfortunately in this day and age you can be without phone hopefully this is good alternative for someone else but did not get that lucky,2,Not Recommend

galaxy tab s9,so far the tablet ha been amazing this is the first time own tablet so wa really satisfied with the size of the s9 to be honest wa going to buy the s9 ultra until realized that just wanted it for reading and perhaps basic gaming e dead cell gacha game etc wa worried about the s9 since did not know what to expect for 11 but it ha been great and work well if you are planning to use the tablet a book video watcher and basic gaming believe the s9 will suffice since already have great laptop realized that bigger size wa useless for me so the size for consumer that is planning to use it for basic function will be happy to know that the s9 is more than enough like the design of this tablet it look super nice and the included pen help lot when maneuvering around the screen actually own samsung galaxy note 9 which is old but it came with pen a well but never used it however with the table believe it is critical since it is too big for me to reach the top of the screen and this is an 11 can not imagine how hard would have been if had bigger one the only bad thing can think of is not with the table itself but with this listing they tell you it will come with free book cover but didn receive it amazon wa nice enough to give me partial refund but now have no cover t so yeah don expect free book cover actually this is why lowered the rating since the product itself is fantastic nonetheless the retailer failed to provide me with what they promised even when went to their website they didn help at all it wa annoying since they will be like go here go there to end up not getting anything and wasting time tl dr the tablet is great come with nice pen and is beautifully designed however they didn give me book cover nonetheless amazon helped me by giving me partial refund,4,Recommend

in-ear wired headphone,i made mistake the original earpods that came with my apple iphone 6 plus started cutting out decided for the cheaper option of the amazon headphone rather than slightly more expensive earpod replacement now regret that decision the amazon headphone are not even close to the same comfort fit quality a the apple earpods no matter how tried just couldn fit the amazon headphone in my ear tried the different size and twisted they would stay in few minute and then pop out it wa disaster for exercising found the amazon headphone very uncomfortable they didn just sit in the ear like the apple earpods they had to be squeezed inside the ear canal obviously apple and all manufacture have patent on their design that amazon can not copy so amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design it just not good and it plugged the ear so much that heard my breathing and heartbeat once put them in couldn wait to get them back out the sound quality is garbage it not even close to the quality of the apple earpods the sound is loud but very harsh and tinny guess if never had any headphone before and used the amazon headphone would probably just accept it because had nothing to compare it to however had the apple earpods so could make direct comparison it not even close so went ahead and ordered another apple earpods which is only about 5 more should have done that initially can not recommend the amazon headphone,2,Not Recommend

in-ear wired headphone,the headphone look decent and well made they are really light in weight the sound quality is quite good for the price but do not expect to beat 100 plus phone with their low end bit lacking the bass response feel boosted in the middle third they are really really loud had no problem using them for meeting call and even to listen to music the biggest complaint have is that they fall off very easily from the ear the rubber replaceable cup are very thin and do not hold at all whatever you do replaced the supplied one with my own from another headphone and that improved the situation in summary the phone have bit too much attack for my taste to listen to music but did not buy them to listen to music anyway five star overall,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,so have had zero issue with the fingerprint reader it is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in even put case on mine and can still reach the finger reader so actually think it really great it much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one what like about this phone too is that it is thinner used to have the moto charge and that wa definitely much wider and didn realize how much more uncomfortable it is now when pick that one up to try and compare to this one it such beast in such tank whereas this new phone it thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if m holding it like cut which is very nice and can reach everything on it with my thumb the fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size a my old phone just no longer have big phone because it didn take up the whole screen it had side on it before so really like that this one is the whole screen and that it slimmer have nice case on it and have screen protector on the front and m still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine my only thing is yes the battery doe last all day my old phone my battery could last couple day but it wa an ex charge and the battery wa supposed to do that but the bonus about this phone here is it doe tell me if keep continuing using it at the rate that am it tell me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery so that easy for me to be like oh okay well m going to be going and doing this so maybe should charge it now but typically only charge it at night when m going to sleep it doe have spam detection for call which didn realize wa thing and ve had couple phone call like pop up but never ring and then they go away and am notified that they were spam and then have verified and they actually are indeed spam so that ha been really nice also like that can give name to my group chat everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what m used to it did take little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there wa no back button couldn figure it out but if you just hold off to the side little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between thing ve found my screen now ha five icon across compared to my old one that had only four icon across so for me that fine because can see them fine haven looked to see if can change that so if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be benefit but otherwise for me since don have that problem this is great really also like that can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pull up my calendar or the weather don have to go search for different app just click on it on my phone and it just take me to that app my other favorite thing is that it is still an android phone absolutely love the android app even have my tablet in android because m just so used to android and prefer android over the counterpart like really dislike apple and apple think is so much more expensive another fun thing is the night mode set bedtime for me and when it my bedtime if m staying up it go into black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then go all right fine yep it bedtime also like the do not disturb because can have thing blocked for when m sleeping so my phone isn ringing or anything and don have to remember to put it on silent it wa automatically doe that unless of course it emergency it is set to if somebody call back within 10 15 minute window that it will ring because it a priority call and have that turned on haven even come close to using all the storage space that have on my phone whereas my old phone wa constantly having to delete thing to get new app if wanted to and it wa very hard to do so like the extra space like how fast it work and like the thinness of it actually a for phone call and stuff don have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely i still get really nice picture this one doe say that it for all carrier and have xfinity mobile and when got the phone checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn i wa very frustrated even set up to start new return with this but then wa on with the people on chat and wa trying to figure it out and even said wa going to try and go somewhere else but here the thing even though that they wouldn help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service have very cheap bill with them just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it just think it like 12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since don use data don have bill each month because my phone is paid off have nothing else going on there so have really great deal with them so want to keep with them so so before decided to actually ship it back pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka my phone actually work really well didn have to change anything with my carrier all had to do wa change my sim card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it not compatible so would say give that try if you do have xfinity and then if it work great if not m sorry you ll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn work but mine work and ve been doing it for two month now and haven had any disruption with my service everything ha been great and haven had to change my billing at all so have really enjoyed having this phone hope my review ha been helpful if it ha been helpful please hit the helpful button,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,an important smartphone release at time when there seems to be real shift away from flagship device and move toward mid range value proposition and with the global economic challanges ahead the release of the pixel 4a could be watershed moment the form factor is ideal for me whilst understand the benefit of larger screen the tradeoff are too big imo the 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light the pure android is plus have had bloatware on my previous two device huawei so it is welcome change the option to pause apps is great too battery is good easily full day now have battery saver mode set to auto enable at 75 and can get 1 5 day of moderate usage have not had chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colour are an improvement over my huawei p30 and so is the video stabilization the p30 ha an excellent camera with some advantage over the 4a but like the result from the 4a more a an aside the p30 wa form favourite of mine the best smartphone had owned ticked lot of box including it compact for factor it edge the 4a on performance the 4a doe suffer from occasional lag and stutter and ha few extra feature like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader but the 4a ha nudged in front of the p30 albeit only slightly anyway am sold on the 4a it delivers in spade don need wireless charging nor do drop my phone in water don need 90 hz display the 4a oled display is excellent btw nor do need facial recognition like having the option of headphone jack though and like having extra money to spend on other thing in life have purchased the spigen rugged armour case which provides excellent protection,5,Recommend

t205bt,i wa looking for budget friendly wireless earphone similar to apple earpods a those in ear type don fit my ear properly then came across the jbl tune 205bt randomly and did not find any review online took the plunge and bought it below is my review after using it for couple of day fit ergonomicsi really love these earpods style earphone a these fit my ear perfectly these are light weight and passed my running jogging test without any issue since got these just wear them around my neck and use it lot without hurting my ear rating 9 10 built qualitybeing jbl product had no doubt that the build quality would be top notch the cable are solid but the button are bit squishy personally prefer clicky tactile button since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wire which are around your ear which imagine would prolong the life of these earphone please note that the center button is to turn off on and put the earphone on pairing mode the other two button are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for second or two to skip track rating 7 10 soundto explain this better ll compare this with my previous earphone boat bassheads which is fairly common now the boat earphone are the in ear type and these usually provide better bass since they have better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking had enabled my phone equalizer and used other software mod viper to improve the sound but still the bass sounded hollow like deep snare drum the jbl tune 205bt is thousand time better in the bass department a found it to be really deep and it ha that thump because of the 12 5mm driver m really impressed that these earpods sound better than in ear earphone and are better than apple earpods too also used previously couple of philip earpods style earphone but they too had the hollow bass effect m currently using the jbl tune 205bt earphone without any equalizer a find it to be tuned perfectly out of box generally listen to hip hop and these jbl earphone really do it justice especially the 808 kick wa bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the review of the wired version of these earphone online but guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum rating 9 10 volume noise cancellationsince these are bluetooth earphone the overall volume will be less than the wired one that being said found the volume to be enough and then some more don expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tip but that great for people who jog run a you have to pay attention to car people shouting etc but turning up the volume you generally don hear outside sound tend to keep mine around 70 75 volume the sound doesn distort at maximum volume rating 7 10 connectivity range callsthe jbl tune 205bt earphone support bluetooth 4 0 meaning no aptx or aptxhd codec support but that okay because the improvement are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music flac have subscription to google play music which play music in 256kbps and have no issue with the quality once these earphone have been paired to your phone the next time you turn it on it connects in 1 2 second did not experience any disconnect or any lag the range wa pretty good leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruption when we talk about call didn find these earphone that good because the microphone rest on your shoulder and m not one of those who shout when talking on the phone but if you have loud voice then this might work for you rating 8 10 battery life charging timethe charging take around 1 to 1 5 hour to charge from 0 all the way till 100 and based on my usage which is lot these earphone easily last me day your mileage might vary added bonus you get the battery info on the status bar m using op3t on oreo rating 8 10 pricei thought thousand of time before buying these a never spent so much for earphone before but in retrospect m glad did buy these especially considering what you re getting in return rating 10 10 conclusionif you re on budget and want earpods style bluetooth earphone then please buy this you won find anything similar or even close to the sound that you re getting have many jbl product 2 bluetooth speaker 1 home theatre system so can vouch for the sound if you re hip hop or an edm head then you can buy this too a these have big driver which won disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizer if this is your first pair of bluetooth earphone then be ready to be pleasantly surprised a these make your life so much easier and can not imagine going back to wired earphone,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,this phone is solid it interesting that in 2020 budget phone is 700 dollar but it is definitely great value for the money the camera aren a great a the regular s20 line up but they are solid upgrade coming from the s8 just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photo get very grainy in less than ideal condition battery life is solid work all week and when m not on my phone lot easily get 2 day and squeeze in few hour from the next day if really can get to another charger if have day off and m on the phone for hour can easily make it to the end of the day at 20 percent the screen is great color are bright and the quality 120 hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate the phone is definitely bigger and closer to the note 20 non ultra model in term of size so that take some getting used to touch could be bit better sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something the fingerprint reader is an optical one so it hit or miss sometimes have found that if pay attention to where place my finger it tends to recognize it more easily just never thought d miss the one on the s8 considering the poor placement of the thing the stereo speaker can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing one found on my old phone reviewer say that the sound is not a rich a the more premium version of this phone bit if you re coming from phone that is over 2 year old with only single speaker you ll enjoy them definitely get phone cover because the plastic back doe scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt a m finding out haptics are another area where samsung cut back on this model the vibration feel close to that of the s7 in cheap way to their credit they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on text box like that found in pixel just don expect solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the s20 model 6 gb of ram is plenty now but may wish had gotten phone with 8 gb in few year after some o update only time will tell it crazy time and hard to believe that phone price have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale it a no brainer and very easy to recommend,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,nothing budget about the price on this phone and yet they still found way to justify removing high use feature that have been available to their faithful user for year on previous model this will not be my last phone but it will be my last samsung if you like to associate different ringtones to individual phone number like freebird to the ex number show me the money to your accountant and some barry white to the new significant other then do not get this phone if you like to use voicemail app that store your phone message on your phone so that you can in two swipe see and delete message and don have to hit four button to call out to 8 number just to hear delete save message then do not get this phone if you prefer to one swipe delete text message from the messaging app and do not want to be forced to use yet four more screen touch to open the text menu delete trash button just to delete text message then do not get this phone if you want to feel 100 assured that your are the first owner of this phone and the phone nor the packaging ha been fiddled with where you have the navy version that the manufacturer associated with the serial number on the phone instead of mint cover to match the designation on box label then do not get this phone however if you love touching your phone with extra unnecessary sub menu then get this phone if you like your phone full of google and samsung apps that you can not remove or disable and that will constantly be up your er in your face on phone that you will pay high dollar for then get this phone if you want to save 100 00 from the carrier for this model and save the extra 200 00 it would take to get phone with real feature then get this phone used to look forward to using my phone and hearing the different tone associated with friend and family thanks samsung sprint for providing substandard product with the release of the s20 fe 5g,2,Not Recommend

t10,i ve had these headphone since september of 2019 but didn use them often until recently wa wearing them the other day and one earbud popped out and dropped into very muddy water it took me couple minute to find it and once did rinsed the mud off with clean water thought they only had water resistant rating and therefore expected the earbud to die nope it kept working that wa when checked and saw they had an ipx8 rating waterproof waterproofing aside find the battery life sufficient for whatever am doing these can outlast me working in the yard and am yet to put the advertised 6 hour runtime to the test like that the case can charge the earbuds though never really need that feature mostly listen to mostly audio book but the sound is quite good the bass is highly improved if you can get the earbuds seated in your ear just right though movement tends to make them shift bit then there the range never really need to go to far from my phone but can if need to one day didn realize left my phone in the kitchen until wa out of my house and the audio started getting choppy reached to my pocket to check my phone and realized left it in the house the distance wa impressive the last feature can think of is the phone call quality wa on call this morning and we both had hd audio phone so the sound wa incredible it wa like being in the same room together didn ask the other person how sounded but they never asked me to repeat something taking into consideration the price of these headphone am more than pleased with them am not saying they are merely acceptable because of the low price these sound and perform much better than expected,5,Recommend

iphone 13,my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object have been using android phone since the last 10 year and finally decided to switch to iphone used to roast iphone for it price lack of feature and also thing like power adapter not given in box etc but my last android phone iqoo 7 legend had lot of software related issue and battery issue after updating it to android 12 tired of bug and software glitch in android finally decided to buy iphone and switch from android to io and boy wa right never even held an iphone in my life before because of it price but now made great choice even if had to spend all my saving on it iphone 13 is so smooth that even my iqoo 7 legend with 120hz feel slower than it even if iphone ha only 60hz and can believe what m seeing all the game apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android wa very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo had 66w fast charger where a for iphone had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs but charging speed isn disappointing display quality is truly flagship level and m quite fan of the small 6 1 display believe it or not being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful build quality is great would recommend not to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro because don think having extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k you can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iphone 13 wide angle camera struggle in low light but main camera is really good capture true colour front camera is really good too truly flagship speaker are great battery life is better than my previous device io is very optimised in term of battery life easy 8hrs sot on normal usage note while playing bgmi you loose around 2 battery every 6minutes at hd extreme graphic which is also good pro max would be far better in term of battery for the software yes feel like there are few downside even if the software is very smooth and ha very less bug it ha two annoying thing any game get paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc lock screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notification is also annoying clearing all notification is also very annoying but other than that perfect 10 10 purchase wa very disappointed at myself when paid for the iphone but when received it wa truly happy that bought it truly worth it,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s10,i ll give you the tldr up front this is good tablet but the ipad pro m4 line is just better for most a consumption device so m fortunate enough to have the 11 ipad pro m4 512gb so this 12 4 galaxy tab s10 512gb while not a direct competitor with this a with the 13 ipad pro m4 aside from the screen size the ipads are identical in term of performance given that here my comparison between the two from the perspective of medium consumption and general purpose tablet usage 1 the packaging this may not be the most important aspect of tablet obviously but there still something really satisfying about ripping open high end device box and well apple ha samsung beaten here the ipad pro box is couple of tab on the top and bottom and you re in the wrapping of the tablet inside is easy to remove without tearing and while apple ha removed bunch of packaging waste from these box the experience still feel good the samsung box well maybe just got unlucky it very similar in that there are two pull tab one top one bottom great however they didn separate a easily leaving me to have to grab box cutter to remove one after wa in wa greeted by the tablet in some kind of annoying baggie that you have to rip open it wa not an attractive procedure even then after that there plastic film around every edge and not in one continuous satisfying removal process nope there load of tiny piece of film so it took several minute to remove it all didn enjoy this 2 setup process this is probably tie both device process are pretty streamlined these day and you can restore from an iphone ipad backup to the tab s10 no issue there 3 hardware this is bit of tricky one some thing are unquestionably better on the samsung and some are unbeatable on the ipad pro m4 the screen for example apple smaller pro screen is 11 264ppi 120hz whereas this samsung is 12 4 at 266ppi and also 120hz of course you can tell the difference in ppi but what wa most apparent is that apple tandem oled screen is ahead of the samsung it brighter both at max brightness punchier more natural and overall the much better experience this wa with the samsung set to it natural image profile and the ipad default true tone on or off for testing though in all situation the apple screen just is better but the 12 4 samsung screen is unquestionably larger for movie watching due to the more movie like aspect ratio along with the larger screen the speaker the samsung is better here the m4 pro ipads are bit tinny result one supposes of the device getting noticeably thinner over the prior model the samsung sound more full it not night and day difference but the apple device this year just don sound a good a they used to software it the whole android v ipados again you like what you like tend to prefer ipados having used both android and ipados for long time it smoother more performant this is likely due to apple always having the fastest tablet and just overall screen responsiveness is apple all the way the other annoyance always have with android tablet is 23 976hz playback for example when using plex on both ipad pro and the tab s10 it obvious that the ipad is significantly smoother don know if the samsung doesn support 5 5 pulldown at 120hz for proper 24p playback but for whatever the reason can ever seem to get smooth 24p from the samsung no matter what setting used the ipad pro smooth a silk especially noticeable on camera pan a it ha been for year on these 24p capable device security like that samsung ha face unlock and fingerprint id unlock both worked flawlessly for me straight out of the box apple only ha faceid faceid is more secure than the face unlock on android but either way samsung make this more convenient with both currently implemented type of biometric security here the fingerprint sensor is under the display so it never in the way excellent performance this is samsung fastest tablet yet well just a the tab s9 wa plenty fast in it own right in day to day usage you probably won see much of difference between the s9 and s10 but there no question the ipad pro m4 ha both beaten it just snappier in general and gaming performance is better on the ipad pro m4 noticed hitch occasionally in even heavier web browsing on the samsung that simply isn there on the ipad additionally both the ipad pro m4 and this samsung tab s10 were able to fully saturate my gigabit internet connection over wifi 6e without issue using speedtest site stylus support after using the pen included with the samsung and the apple pencil pro not included with the ipad find myself preferring the pen for my us even aside from the multitude of gesture the pen support that apple pencil pro never will just prefer how it feel to write on the screen the apple pencil pro always ha that feeling of plastic on glass don like how that feel it not natural the pen feature much softer tip and it glide more easily also have an amazon kindle scribe and adore the way the scribe stylus feel on the screen and the samsung while not a good a the scribe just feel way better to use on the screen than the apple pencil pro the pencil pro still is fantastic with more nuance to shading angle of the drawing etc but the feel on the screen pen all the way drawing latency is a close to flawless a you can imagine on both samsung and apple device oh and the pen is included with the tab s10 so it nice not to have to make another purchase like you do with the ipad expansion and value the tab s10 includes microsd card slot that is big win for consumer given how much it cost to add additional storage internal only on the apple device mean if you need 2tb ipad pro you re spending veritable fortune for the tab s10 not so much you buy 512gb tab s10 and 1 5tb microsd card and you re away for far less than an ipad pro with the equivalent storage sure you don get the raw speed of the internal storage of the ipad but if you don need blazing speed but you do need reasonably fast storage the tab s10 is better value here that said if money is no object the ipad doe offer larger blazing fast storage option that samsung simply doesn it 256gb or 512gb with the samsung and no more which to get if you re an android fan you get an android tablet and the samsung is good it a bit of lazy effort compared to last year with many of the same spec and camera battery capacity etc but it a good device if you re all in on apple you get the ipad pro it just make the most sense to stick with what you re most comfortable with in term of o find ipados to be just little more polished in general and more user friendly if you re starting out with new tablet for the first time that said if you re device agnostic the choice is little harder the ipad pro m4 is faster yes and the screen is better absolutely but the value of the samsung device is hard to argue especially if you need more cheap storage and if you spend lot of your time watching movie and want larger screen the 12 4 samsung is significantly larger than the 11 ipad pro for less money especially when you factor in the included pen for 16 9 movie it about 1 3 larger viewing area than the 11 ipad pro which is significant versus the latest 13 ipad pro the samsung still offer 2 23 larger screen for 16 9 content than the ipad overall 4 out of 5 good but perhaps not a good a it could be,4,Recommend

pixel 4a,i purchased my pixel 4a for couple of reason my iphone 7 plus wa getting little long in the tooth and d been considering an upgrade but even a an iphone user since the original one d become bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on apple phone also a product of the walkman generation really missed having headphone jack fast forward four month and m using an iphone 12 pro max what went wrong nothing absolutely nothing the pixel 4a is really great phone nice form factor always on display fast and responsive fingerprint reader headphone jack and frequent update to it operating system my only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging which is quickly becoming essential to me this is great phone that you can customize to your heart content and if you re not entrenched in apple ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservation say probably because felt very ready to pick up and move away from apple ecosystem however your circle of friend family and co worker should be taken into account what do the people in your life use if it primarily iphone that may provide some friction to your transition over to android in my case found that not being connected to imessage and facetime wa enough of an inconvenience that wa using my ipod touch to replace the feature no longer had access to on my phone silly right that wa my conclusion and went ahead and bought an iphone 12 pro max do like one more than the other suppose the iphone 12 doe feel bit more premium due largely to the fact that it is don think it a question of like though your phone is more question of fit for your life and a positively a felt about the pixel 4a the fit wasn quite right thing may be different for you but can stand behind the pixel 4a a quality phone and bargain at it list price,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s10,i not sure how can sell anyone on this by now most people know what they want from tablet and know that samsung almost always delivers if you re an apple user this isn likely for you not because of any missing or unusual feature but because it run android there a big adjustment if you switch from apple ecosystem to android so if you re thinking about doing so prepare yourself for quite the learning curve now onto the tablet the screen is brilliant absolutely breathtaking quality the touch sensitivity is perfect with and without using the pen the glossy finish make everything look so crisp in term of speed this is lightning fast tablet ve had zero issue with lag or performance and despite the performance being so good it still get amazing battery life what most impressive about the battery life is the standby time went away and left my tablet home and unplugged over week later it wa still going even keeping up with notification find that to be very impressive for connectivity had no issue wi fi setup wa breeze and bluetooth device pair with no problem find folding keyboard is very useful for tablet a it greatly increase productivity when using the tablet for more office centric purpose storage capacity is plentiful even overkill 512 gb go long way with tablet don do much in the way of taking photo or video with it a find tablet too bulky to enjoy photography with so in that regard the storage is substantial overkill when you don plan to take photo or video with it but if you do you ll still be fine for good while overall this is top tier tablet it very pricey but you get lot for that price one very annoying thing though is that like apple samsung ha decided to take away the power charging brick from the box at over thousand buck that just super annoying this should be provided a charging over usb without it is much slower,5,Recommend

iphone 13,you really don need to upgrade if you bought new iphone last year but anyone with an iphone 11 or older will find enough new part and feature to consider the new modelsscreenthe screen is notably better than last year it the first iphone with apple promotion display very high refresh rate screen technology that wa introduced on the ipad pro in 2017 the screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make thing feel smoother if you re just reading website for example it might refresh less frequently and save battery life but then if you re gaming or scrolling through long webpage it ll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother batterybattery life is top notch and last longer than any other iphone on the market unless you re playing game for hour and hoursthat thanks to combination of newer processor new screen and bigger battery streamed nine hour of movie for example with just over 50 brightness and still had more than half the battery left camerathe regular wide angle the zoom and the ultra wide angle lens on the back now allow in more light which mean they re better at taking picture in the dark the hdr feature is also better in situation where your subject might have lot of light behind them which can normally make people in picture look dark all the iphone 13 phone can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone you can get really close to an object like blueberry or flower and capture lot of detail,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,i had the pixel 4a for month in late 2020 and generally liked the phone the most important part that make this phone great is the price 350 it not going to get you any top tier iphone 12 pro max or galaxy note 20 ultra but it give you everything the general user would possibly need decently fast snapdragon 730g soc 6gb ram and 128gb storage that something that not even the 830 base configuration of iphone 12 get you of course being 350 there are few thing that it miss out on compared to higher tier phone one of those thing would be the plastic unibody build over something like metal and glass sandwich on phone of this price point it fine though did have bit of plastic creaking near the sim slot it wa just an annoyance at worst because the rest of the plastic build felt fine wireless charging is also not present this may disappoint some that used it but it didn bother me cause never used wireless charging on my iphone 8 there no water resistance either which did raise my eyebrow bit before bought the phone but don submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty place one thing this doe have that the 700 pixel 5 doesn have is headphone jack so if you still use anything with 3 5mm plug this phone ha you covered with no need for adapter the speaker are also quite good with one speaker on the bottom next to the usb port and one built into the earpiece a for the software it got three year of update which is better than many android manufacture but it still won top apple software support did notice few software bug when used it mainly with youtube vanced pip mode after certain amount of time restarting fixed the issue but it wa an annoyance hopefully that wa just android 11 and that get fixed with future update battery life is also pretty decent better than the aging battery on my iphone 8 since could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night given that it a small phone by today standard it not going to be battery life king but it better than the 400 iphone se the size is something loved about this phone my hand are relatively small and like my phone to be pocketable which is something that m not fan of with most new phone being over 6 inch in size the 5 81 inch edge to edge screen is of similar size to my iphone 8 and the iphone thus could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pocket this is something m sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phone the camera ha been the definition of the pixel phone since the first one launched in 2016 this phone ha an amazing single 12mp lens mostly made great by google computational photography software night mode wa very nice to use a in the scenario used it in it helped out take better photo at night m no expert with camera so don know much about white balance dynamic range etc do like how this phone give you one great camera a opposed to other manufacturer which give you like seven different pretty much useless camera sensor overall this is the phone to buy if you re on budget of less than 500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general need would suggest going for the pixel 4a 5g version if you can afford 500 phone a that ha second ultrawide camera lens faster snapdragon 765g soc and a the name say 5g connectivity that phone will overall will give you very very close experience to the pixel 5 but if you don have that much to put down for phone and if you like the standard 4a smaller size this phone is the way to go highly recommend it and would personally pick this any day of the week over similarly priced phone from china brand like oppo xiaomi zte vivo etc,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,this wa quite step up for me going from htc desire 526 smart phone to the google pixel 4a smartphone like the fact that it is unlocked never buy phone that is not in that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice ve been with verizon for 4 year now and they keep giving me perk for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feed you now about the phone itself like the fact it had transfer device with it so transferring my file pic and contact wa very easy for me and granted am not real techie but can do few thing without help like the fact it ha 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card great camera too like you can set it to block out telemarketers it take very little time to charge it and the charge last very long time 12 hour approximately depending on what you do with your phone am not gamer a view it a big waste of time the phone ha limitless potential like the oled screen too it very light and thin which is nice do suggest you get good rubber armor for it which did people talk to ask me what kind of phone am on now because sound really good on it you won experience drop call on this phone no matter where you are m 68 year young and hope this will be the last phone will ever own until the day they put me in box it ha great assortment of ringer sound to choose from or if you don want to be disturbed you can set it to that too great wi fi too and you can turn it into your own private wi fi hotspot if you choose to do so which think is very cool don think you can go wrong with this phone a like said before the potential of what it can do seem to be limitless also the learning curve is quite easy and it an android iphones are just name and you pay dearly for it ll stick to android phone in conclusion would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for very functional and efficient proficient phone buy it you won regret it,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,i purchased my pixel 4a for couple of reason my iphone 7 plus wa getting little long in the tooth and d been considering an upgrade but even a an iphone user since the original one d become bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on apple phone also a product of the walkman generation really missed having headphone jack fast forward four month and m using an iphone 12 pro max what went wrong nothing absolutely nothing the pixel 4a is really great phone nice form factor always on display fast and responsive fingerprint reader headphone jack and frequent update to it operating system my only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging which is quickly becoming essential to me this is great phone that you can customize to your heart content and if you re not entrenched in apple ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservation say probably because felt very ready to pick up and move away from apple ecosystem however your circle of friend family and co worker should be taken into account what do the people in your life use if it primarily iphone that may provide some friction to your transition over to android in my case found that not being connected to imessage and facetime wa enough of an inconvenience that wa using my ipod touch to replace the feature no longer had access to on my phone silly right that wa my conclusion and went ahead and bought an iphone 12 pro max do like one more than the other suppose the iphone 12 doe feel bit more premium due largely to the fact that it is don think it a question of like though your phone is more question of fit for your life and a positively a felt about the pixel 4a the fit wasn quite right thing may be different for you but can stand behind the pixel 4a a quality phone and bargain at it list price,5,Recommend

ipad pro 13-inch m4,in contrast to my usual practice of upgrading my ipad pro two year later made an exception due to close friend borrowing my previous ipad pro model from 2021 unfortunately he dropped or let it fall off the couch resulting in cracked screen since wa out of warranty quickly realized that replacing the screen would be quite costly consequently decided to gift the ipad to my friend and purchase new one instead typically opt for the ipad pro with the highest memory and cellular data option however my carrier mobile wa only offering deal on an ipad at the time they would have applied the credit to any ipad product in the past but this time they refused therefore saved significant amount of money by purchasing the ipad from amazon which already take percentage off the top this wa the most favorable deal available for an apple product to further reduce expense opted for an ipad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity given that already subscribe to premium icloud service it made no sense to pay for the highest level of memory in summary made wise decision by purchasing the ipad at reasonable price the ipad itself feature several improvement including the m4 processor thinner design and upgraded camera overall am satisfied with my purchase while typically purchase my ipad pro through my carrier which come with subsidy am retired now and occasionally consider commuting and traveling however my travel frequency is limited and can easily connect to wi fi at home restaurant or other establishment logically wa able to save substantial amount of money by purchasing the premium apple product and opting for the ipad without cellular data and the highest memory capacity am very pleased with my decision although could have potentially saved even more money by purchasing the subsidized ipad nine would have ended up paying more due to the monthly fee in conclusion if you decide to purchase an ipad it is essential to get the magic keyboard case and the apple pencil pro a they complement the product and enhance it functionality,5,Recommend

galaxy s24+,i thought d treat myself for my birthday and get myself nice new phone got the s24 and at first wa happy with it however 3 to 4 week later noticed couple of small dot in the lower corner of the display where the display seemed washed out immediately went through the process of sending it in to get it repaired thinking that it would certainly be covered a it wa clearly manufacturing defect few day later get message telling me d need to pay 300 to get it fixed called in and they tell me it an impact related issue in other word that must have dropped my phone and therefore it must be my fault hadn even had the phone for month yet and can say with absolute certainty that never dropped it or did anything else to it that would cause the issue tried to explain that to their customer service tried to point out that the screen isn cracked that it look like it a de lamination issue explained that m an engineer and that work at an electronics manufacturing plant and that know what m talking about the person wa talking to just kept telling me that wa wrong because the report he wa reading said it wa impact related and of course in the time it took for all of this to play out it now 3 day over the 1 month refund so basically just got scammed out of 1000 personally would go with different company that ha better customer support this is just insulting added photo you can see the three spot circled they aren chip or crack and the pixel still light up you can also see that while the glass go out to the edge of the screen the spot stop right at the edge of the display clearly that is the display peeling off of the glass and no kind of impact related damage is going to cause that while leaving the rest of the phone completely unharmed yes they are small and if they stay like that won be thrilled but can live with it but hadn even had the phone for month when they showed up so am expecting the issue to get worse,1,Not Recommend

galaxy s24+,after having this phone for 9months am so disappointed that want to let reader know that this phone is not worth it after 4 month of usage notice that the keyboard sometime doe not sense what am typing so it will miss letter or two sometime have to press the apps more than once for it to react too now a am traveling using esim in another country notice the phone doe not receive full a to my previous s10 therefore am glad have my old s10 a backup to switch the sim card and now the signal is strong again one more thing when am all by myself and nothing around me is moving can hear the mechanic inside the phone making noise overall have feeling that this phone won last me another year which is why is not worth your money,2,Not Recommend

t110bt,got them for about 2k and have been using more than couple of hour each day definitely worth the price sound quality average but that mean it doesn do anything terribly the bass isn a punchy and the treble could have been more defined but there is no noise so the mids come through clearly perfect for my choice of music the volume is bit lower than wired earphone but there is no distortion at peak volume not that it should be used at those you could get wired earphone with similar sound quality at abt 1k so that make sense considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware battery life now this could be done better either the should have given larger battery or had better battery management software it doesn turn off if it is paired but not used for an extended period so you have to make sure that you switch it off manually last about 4 5 hr on less than 50 volume durability us flat wire and the built seems sturdy definitely better than my sennheiser earphone other feature call quality is decent enough mic is not that great need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up bit button are decent and work without fail there is bright led on the control capsule let people know you can hear them wire is bit too long could ve been couple of inch shorter each side but the balance is good fit snugly in your ear doesn fall out the earphone bundle up nicely and take practically no space in your pocket overall given the price meet my expectation wasn expecting them to match something worth 6k or more but doesn disappoint for the money spent,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s6 lite,this is the third samsung tablet that have purchased over the last 12 year am loyal and happy samsung customer first tablet lasted for year second one not a long but that on me should have purchased one with more memory since my gaming habit increased but it wa still great product so decided to purchase new tablet with more memory and more capability to manage my increased usage beyond game received my tablet promptly and wa extremely happy with my purchase went to bed one night with the tablet working and when got up in the morning it wa dead not completely dead but just flickering screen and no way to turn off or reboot guess got lemon sometimes this happens and product is just defective so began the return process would still buy this tablet again but amazon did not give me an option to replace instead of getting shipping label got an insert for the package and instruction telling me that the ups man would pick up the package and bring me the label and that needed to be home for the next several day for when he showed up wa dubious but gave it fair shot monday three called the ups number provided to me and wa told that there wa not pick up scheduled and that should contact amazon live in relatively rural area and honestly ups doesn do scheduled pick ups we have local business that also is ups drop off center that ha dedicated staff for ups service so brought my package and instruction to the drop off and the staff tried to figure out return option on my amazon account but ended up giving me the amazon number and instructed me to explain to them that need an actual mailing label and that we don have scheduled pick ups locally except for the drop off center called amazon and explained my situation the first representative talked wa courteous and tried to be helpful but admitted she could not figure it out so she wa transferring me to specialist wow this so called specialist wa terrible told her am literally at staffed ups center a we speak and we could get this resolved now but that the scheduled pickup really wasn a viable option she completely ignored anything said and just continued to process this the way she wanted and then told me that it would get picked up in the next 7 day and of course need to be present for the pickup she tried to justify this by saying that because of the value of the product it needed to be handed to the courier okay but am at the ups center with an actual human being who can address this issue so it really is not an issue at all now have to call ups on monday and make sure there is pickup scheduled doubtful and then call and bug amazon to get it right and continue this for how long no am going to drive to the actual ups hub that 20 mile away on tuesday if this is not completely in place on monday from friday morning to monday is long enough to schedule pickup am honestly aggravated by the whole experience last word buy samsung but think about if you should buy it on amazon because if you have to return it then it will be nightmare apparently it make sense to amazon that person will be home and available for an entire week for package to get picked up 2 star because it a good product and glitch happen but amazon get negative rating on customer service in this case update finally got this picked up and the ups man asked why couldn you bring this to the ups at toner planet lol he said they can print the label just a easily well just relieved it got picked up hopefully the return is now hassle free,2,Not Recommend

galaxy buds 3 pro ai,loved these samsung bud for the first couple of day before noticed some con loved how they would read out your text message so you don have to pull out your phone to read your text message the sound is absolutely amazing m big bass head and they really pack punch can care less about the blade light don really use them they are pretty comfortable to wear just like the airpods pro but even lighter in weight didn use the translate feature that much but could see for someone else it could be very useful time to break down the con and the biggest one for me is the battery life it is complete garbage compared to other earbuds that are way more cheaper you get at least 2 1 2 hour with the bud and the charging case suck too only get 3 complete charge when the case and the bud are fully charged so ll have to charge them everyday before heading out the door another huge con ha to be the ear detection for noise cancelation they really need to be more sensitive when in your ear ve tried using the medium and large tip and still have the same issue have to constantly keep pushing them deeper in my ear because the noise cancelation mode would switch to normal if they are not fully secure so talking smiling working out and pretty much anything that involves pushing out the bud completely ruined it for me the last con have is the design don why they went with this triangle shaped stem but they can cause functioning issue there are multiple time will pinch the stem to pause my music or answer phone call and they will not work the first time know they were trying to avoid design similar to the airpods pro but think they should ve kept the stem round a well it just feel super awkward when pinching these bud are completely overpriced and definitely need some software update to fix the ear detection and touch control hopefully they ll fix those issue woth the new gen but m staying away from samsung bud for while and use bud that have physical touch control,2,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,i moved from note 8 to the pixel 4a and it wa mostly pleasant experience but in the end switched back wa initially concerned with how much smaller this phone is compared to my note but the smaller size started to grow on me it easy to hold and you can reach all the button one handed the material and weight of the phone doe make it feel cheaper but it material did have nice feel to it and the button are very clicky the battery life on this phone wa amazing got close to 34 hour from full charge this wa drastic improvement over my note which barely make it through half the day now the camera wa pretty decent but must admit did not take very many photo think prefer the camera from my note over this one my favorite part about the pixel 4a is actually the android 11 experience the pixel software feature are well thought out and really improved my daily interaction the automatic call screening is huge relief from the frequent sale and spam call would receive throughout the day the phone would try to suggest set time for bed to gain better sleep and auto dim change the color temperature and adjust the notification setting the software with the phone feel really polished and it wa wonderful experience to use now for the con one of my biggest issue is google did not provide an ipx rating for this phone yes it is cheap phone but do not want to accidentally cause water damage from using it in rain because we don know it rating other negative in my opinion are no face unlock id not iris unlock the fingerprint scanner work well but not perfect especially if it get the slightest bit dirty also have gotten pretty spoiled with wireless charging so the pixel 4a not having that feature wa huge let down this is an awesome phone for what it doe at this price point but m switching back to my note 8 and eagerly awaiting the pixel 5 release,4,Recommend

pixel 4a,i had the pixel 4a for month in late 2020 and generally liked the phone the most important part that make this phone great is the price 350 it not going to get you any top tier iphone 12 pro max or galaxy note 20 ultra but it give you everything the general user would possibly need decently fast snapdragon 730g soc 6gb ram and 128gb storage that something that not even the 830 base configuration of iphone 12 get you of course being 350 there are few thing that it miss out on compared to higher tier phone one of those thing would be the plastic unibody build over something like metal and glass sandwich on phone of this price point it fine though did have bit of plastic creaking near the sim slot it wa just an annoyance at worst because the rest of the plastic build felt fine wireless charging is also not present this may disappoint some that used it but it didn bother me cause never used wireless charging on my iphone 8 there no water resistance either which did raise my eyebrow bit before bought the phone but don submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty place one thing this doe have that the 700 pixel 5 doesn have is headphone jack so if you still use anything with 3 5mm plug this phone ha you covered with no need for adapter the speaker are also quite good with one speaker on the bottom next to the usb port and one built into the earpiece a for the software it got three year of update which is better than many android manufacture but it still won top apple software support did notice few software bug when used it mainly with youtube vanced pip mode after certain amount of time restarting fixed the issue but it wa an annoyance hopefully that wa just android 11 and that get fixed with future update battery life is also pretty decent better than the aging battery on my iphone 8 since could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night given that it a small phone by today standard it not going to be battery life king but it better than the 400 iphone se the size is something loved about this phone my hand are relatively small and like my phone to be pocketable which is something that m not fan of with most new phone being over 6 inch in size the 5 81 inch edge to edge screen is of similar size to my iphone 8 and the iphone thus could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pocket this is something m sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phone the camera ha been the definition of the pixel phone since the first one launched in 2016 this phone ha an amazing single 12mp lens mostly made great by google computational photography software night mode wa very nice to use a in the scenario used it in it helped out take better photo at night m no expert with camera so don know much about white balance dynamic range etc do like how this phone give you one great camera a opposed to other manufacturer which give you like seven different pretty much useless camera sensor overall this is the phone to buy if you re on budget of less than 500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general need would suggest going for the pixel 4a 5g version if you can afford 500 phone a that ha second ultrawide camera lens faster snapdragon 765g soc and a the name say 5g connectivity that phone will overall will give you very very close experience to the pixel 5 but if you don have that much to put down for phone and if you like the standard 4a smaller size this phone is the way to go highly recommend it and would personally pick this any day of the week over similarly priced phone from china brand like oppo xiaomi zte vivo etc,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,the two great thing about the pixel are it price point and camera everything else including proper camera control wa forgotten the main issue is the screen sensitivity have medium sized hand and finger size 9 10 and am quite adept at typing but felt like wa losing my mind and motor skill trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at it tallest and least cluttered setting tried typing the same sentence on different device and would have 4x the amount of error on that keyboard it doe help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection most of the new feature and control advertised are either novelty poorly implemented or downright dysfunctional the gesture control are chaotic basically making the entire edge of the screen very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it trying to scroll down through long article nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app want to pas the phone to someone to show them photo nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they ll wonder what you were trying to show them so switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait they put button for live transcription right next to the square overview button so there have been many occasion that unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing walk through the wood or me muttering to myself while editing or programming use lot of google home device and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world google like your saying voldemort in some rowling novel or else you get cursed with the assistant trying to search for or make music selection based off of snippet of your completely unrelated conversation finally that lovely little camera ha the worst most non intuitive control have ever used on phone sure you can get some great astrophotography shot but you have to turn on night sight mode and hope that the camera detects star or something to trigger the mode yes you can shoot astrophotography unless the phone think that is what you want try fighting phone control in the late evening in 20 degree yosemite park and you ll wish you had dslr with actual button so you can keep your glove on touch screen glove are thin and don work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issue switching between camera mode requires swipe and then some have popup so to go from portrait mode to slow mo you have to carefully swipe over couple icon and then touch one of the option that appears above video all with very temperamental screen it is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shot also have feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by google a they are already releasing thing for the 5 and 5g model that aren available for this one then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing feature a well for now am going back to my old phone very unsupported cracked and dull lg g6 and now being both burnt out from the new pixel android mobile and the io option may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying smart phone and go for simpler approach,1,Not Recommend

pixel 4a,this phone wa purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the pixel 3a after several week of waiting for the new phone to ship after it wa released am very pleased with the functionality of this new pixel 4a one of the biggest selling point for this phone is the price didn want to finance another 800 phone from verizon so opted for an unlocked phone that could purchase and connect to their network this phone wa bargain at 349 but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price the good besides winning on price this phone wa breeze to set up the sim card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the verizon network without issue the set up instruction were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly the pixel 4a also transferred all data apps and picture from my old galaxy s7 it used usb cable to connect and download everything even text voicemail and everything else transferred over so never felt lost google chrome and gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved password also transferred over apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issue but nothing that couldn be fixed once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate it is bit different than th 3a and other android phone a there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipe it take some getting used to but work smoothly once you get it down the camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used another bonus with this phone is the battery life which rank high on my list of important feature this battery last all day long even with regular use the battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome it also charge very quickly with the provided charger and estimate full charge take approximately one hour the bad the bad really isn all that bad when taken in proper context there is reason this phone is half the price of other model since it missing some luxury feature apparently this phone isn waterproof which come a surprise to me since ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phone around water wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing it really isn a big deal though since the battery last so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway this phone doe take usc cable so it isn compatible with the cable from older android and kindle device which use micro usb cable it come with one usb cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra one around the house or in the car again not huge deal because of the battery life summary this is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of user it operates and look far more expensive than it really is making me realize how much the phone company are ripping u off selling overpriced phone it win in value setup camera operating speed and battery life minor point are lost for missing some of the fancier feature like wireless charging and being different charging cable than most people already have but those don weigh heavily on my opinion of this google pixel 4a so am giving this strong four star,4,Recommend

iphone 14 unlocked,so it my first iphone and always thought iphones are just way superior to android phone turn out that the phone is overall pretty bad especially io is lacking some fundamental function that you would take for granted like back button for example another example when apple is so superior why do have to stay with the default icon on my screen can even change the theme of my phone without paying well can at least change the order of my icon on the screen a like right no you can when am on my iphone and want to know the date have to pull down whole as screen to see it who need to know what day it is anyways people who like apple obviously not for every setting need to go on my home screen and tab the setting icon when hear loud music the phone is annoying me with warning that the music is too loud that you can turn off wanted to give it back but waited to long this is by far my least favorite but also my most expensive phone ever had,2,Not Recommend
galaxy s21 fe,nothing budget about the price on this phone and yet they still found way to justify removing high use feature that have been available to their faithful user for year on previous model this will not be my last phone but it will be my last samsung if you like to associate different ringtones to individual phone number like freebird to the ex number show me the money to your accountant and some barry white to the new significant other then do not get this phone if you like to use voicemail app that store your phone message on your phone so that you can in two swipe see and delete message and don have to hit four button to call out to 8 number just to hear delete save message then do not get this phone if you prefer to one swipe delete text message from the messaging app and do not want to be forced to use yet four more screen touch to open the text menu delete trash button just to delete text message then do not get this phone if you want to feel 100 assured that your are the first owner of this phone and the phone nor the packaging ha been fiddled with where you have the navy version that the manufacturer associated with the serial number on the phone instead of mint cover to match the designation on box label then do not get this phone however if you love touching your phone with extra unnecessary sub menu then get this phone if you like your phone full of google and samsung apps that you can not remove or disable and that will constantly be up your er in your face on phone that you will pay high dollar for then get this phone if you want to save 100 00 from the carrier for this model and save the extra 200 00 it would take to get phone with real feature then get this phone used to look forward to using my phone and hearing the different tone associated with friend and family thanks samsung sprint for providing substandard product with the release of the s20 fe 5g,2,Not Recommend

testmodel,i will admit that these are the first high end ear bud for me to buy and try out ve gone through many cheaper one but decided to try out something more have samsung galaxy ultra s23 phone to pair this with thing like sound quality is amazing can pick out individual note good bass can hear people talk and can hear from different angle think it a good a my higher end over ear headphone for the pc the noise canceling is really good remove maybe 80 of other noise leaving only very slight hum great when trying to zone out with thing going on around you easily connects and switch between phone pc and other device stay in your ear when exercising had bought an over the ear attachment thinking this would fall out while running exercising but it stay put and never needed it good fit inside ear even ha test to fit in the app took bit to get use too but control make it easy to use by hand pause next track go back volume up or down mic work wellnegatives battery life is good but could be better have now and then run into one side draining faster than the other use of noise canceling drain it much faster prob getting 70 80 of advertised time guessing at it might get more rubber ear attachment medium is good fit but wondering if need medium small wish it came with more than small medium and large attachment wish it came with tool to clean it but got 5 one and work great just scraper felt marker like thing ear wax build up very compared to others but think it is worth it if these hold up have read on reddit some user having issue,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,i should start by saying that up until got the 4a wa repeat offender of the iphone wa ready to cut the cord and get an android and thought wa going to love my pixel for the sheer fact that it wasn an iphone ve had this since the week it came out about 2 month now and regret this purchase immensely the pixel is really quirky it stutter and lag with frustrating frequency when hitting button often taking 2 3 second to think before executing the task you told it to even if it just to close window beyond that constantly find myself clicking on thing didn intend to it seems a if when making swipe like scrolling through website it lag for split second mid swipe and read it a if you re clicking on whatever is under your thumb at the moment of the lag this is extremely frustrating when you find yourself constantly clicking on ad accidentally or unintentionally liking your ex girlfriend instagram post a you scroll through your feed believe me your excuse won be considered valid in the eye of your current partner it interface is unintuitive which ll admit is partially learning curve with the switch from apple to android hate to compare it to my iphone 7 but that all know simple thing like vibration pattern red notification dot on app icon etc that are standard on an iphone are not standard option on android understand that people want the opportunity to fully customize their phone but don want to have to learn how to program macro to make my phone vibrate setting less annoying the camera that everyone raf about it just okay certainly better than the iphone 7 but there something artificial about it photo make everything look almost like plastic and definitely not natural plus the photo library is maze of confusing folder it requires navigating through 5 6 folder and sub folder to attach photo to text from an sm app when you save photo that is sent to you you think it would go into your photo library but no it go into it own message subfolder that you ll have to dig for later m sure there a macro for that but mon call volume is bipolar at best it is either whisper quiet even at full volume on speakerphone or deafeningly loud even when my volume is at 0 not an exaggeration literally 0 the volume of the call is sometimes eardrum bursting it inconsistent you never know what you re going to get and m almost scared to put the phone to my ear in fear of rupturing an ear drum the kicker for me and the reason finally decided to write this review wa earlier today when started hearing voice come from my phone while it wa not being used sitting at my desk doing work with all apps closed screen black and faint voice start emitting from the phone like wa in group call don think m in need of s ance but also can explain that and it doesn make me feel comfortable about this phone in any way don want to sound entirely negative the plastic casing that most people complain about doesn bug me it make the phone lightweight and let be honest do you know anyone who doesn use phone case even though the screen is mid grade it more than adequate and m glad that it ha headphone jack even if it just for nostalgia and collecting pocket lint at this point m considering my 400 loss know m in the minority here all the professional phone review rave about this phone but they only used it for few hour maybe couple of day this ha been my personal experience do what you want with it a for me m deactivating this phone and going back to my iphone 7 this wa horrible experience and regretful purchase,1,Not Recommend

galaxy tab a9+,i ve been computer user for many year not an expert though and own samsung smart phone and laptop so m not novice to technology but am for tablet it come with lot of bloatware easily removed and wa able to easily pair my phone setting to the tablet wirelessly no problem haven tried using the tablet a phone yet but probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside so far have enjoyed it but am disappointed that samsung ha sooooo many update that consume lot of time knew there would be lot of update when first turned it on but several day in can still expect samsung update almost on daily basis and this is after ve done all the customizing that want drive me nut so encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to not do auto update or you ll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something do them on command or schedule them samsung get with it and bundle update so they are less frequent albeit more time consuming for each one other than that apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good a are response time when moving from app to app or screen to screen the battery life ha been very good so far and seems better than my cell phone one thing don understand is why samsung ha offset the search bar on the home screen it is off center to the left on the screen no matter how turn the device not deal breaker but just look very odd if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen the tablet is quite light very thin and the 10 size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me especially like the touch keyboard that automatically display with the google search bar once get past my learning curve m sure ll have more to say but all in all m mostly happy with the purchase,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,my last phone wa samsung a10e and anyone coming from cheap series phone can for sure tell you that this is major upgrade got the 128gb s21 fe model and only paid 590 usd for the black version despite really really wanting the white version yet that one wa priced at 699 usd would pay 699 for it probably not but everyone ha different budget for everything when received the phone it came in it regular factory box which is very thin like wa concerned for second that they just sent me case but nope they ve cut down on everything that they send you it came with the phone manual in tiny box sim card tool behind that box and believe short type cable already have charging cable so didn pay any attention to it not that big of deal really it just worried me for second haha now m someone who worry about storage and this phone doe not come with micro sd card slot unlike the s20 fe however ve not had any problem with my storage yet still have roughly 61gb out of the 128gb to go the system itself is 22 5gb which is expected a this is very beefy and fast machine and then play lot of game so my apps take around 39gb don take many photo either so only have around 1gb used but if you are someone who love to take photo recommend getting separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photo over a spending 70 130 for just 128gb of more storage is lot when you could use that to get around 500gb on standalone drive it is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone also add 2gb of ram to it giving it speed boost but m about to go over some thing about the phone speed a for game wise play genshin impact colorful stage project sekai stardew valley pokemon go and fallout shelter and this thing run them all like beast wouldn recommend getting the extra 2gb of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it anyone who ever played genshin impact know how heavy the game is and it can run it at max setting just fine the only problem is that it get incredibly hot so hot that it lowkey hurt to touch after playing for more than just 5 15 minute this could be completely fixed if you get cooling mount for around 20 30 do prioritize game functionality and speed over look so do play extremely comfortably in low medium setting a it still look great however if you re looking for gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum setting on heavy game since bigger temperature mean lowering the processing of your game causing lag ll have to recommend looking for different phone such a an iphone or oneplus since they do that well the camera is good for me take photo of my dog and that it it also ha 30x zoom which is crazy the front camera is really good and sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like goldfish and it super funny haha the fingerprint reader work extremely well even with screen protector fun fact found you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it ll unlock so you don even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press power button wa never fan of 120hz screen and still am not but it look super smooth when have it turned on the amoled screen wa huge game changer for me it beautiful and ha incredible contrasting color know people say they have ton of issue with the battery to this device but honestly haven had any problem whatsoever now do keep medium power saving mode on a just don see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background service when you re not using it it last about day and half work 9 5 and come home with 70 battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently now will say there ha been some connectivity issue during heavy storm and heavy storm only but experienced that issue with my last phone so there a massive chance that just my mobile data provider which is u cellular by the way this phone is unlocked so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use also think it support 2 sim card m not too sure a m not someone who would ever have to use it but if you are then that a plus overall this phone is absolutely amazing and 11 10 recommend it,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,with this phone the hardware and the software are allowed to integrate into their perfect potential google being the creator of both is likely what make this phone better than it overpriced competitor haven had the phone for quite month yet so ll update this review if need to here where more budget phone surprisingly stand out 1 the speaker ha more clarity versus that of the note10 2 the fingerprint reader on the back ha much higher success rate than the note10 in regard to accuracy it is also easier to physically use 3 google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked so if you are feeling bold you can load on custom rom who know maybe that would help you learn to love coding it did for me 4 insane battery life charge it every other night and this isn with light use d say the same might be true for you 5 the ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold it rarely fall out of my hand unlike the note10 it really should get star off for not being water resistant and another half star off for not supporting wireless charging but it just such well performing machine that refuse to subtract anything from my rating tl dr this is the closest android you can get to what make an iphone so special which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,i got my s9 after my s4 crapped out after 5 year screen went off wasn even cracked my s4 s9 served me very well had the s9 for 4 year it simply is an amazing phone wa at crowded place and someone knocked my elbow while holding it it fell and the screen cracked pretty bad not like one crack many crack screen still work perfectly but wa scared it could stop working at any time so needed new phone looked at the s21 fe and s22 at the time purchased the price were about 200 different then week after purchased price were the same but m happy with my purchase liked small phone in the past never had bigger one am actually enjoying the larger screen better for viewing content m guy and my pant pocket are plenty large for this phone a well feel no different than my previous s9 in my pocket ve watched lot of youtube review of the camera video quality test pic and footage and it seems they are almost the same sometimes prefer and think the s21 fe image video look better others the s22 look better kind of toss up so what have noticed well battery life is amazing beat my s9 by far now my s9 wa 4 year old when had to replace it now use the s9 a camera m not worried about losing or breaking had the s9 for long time and can not remember how good battery life wa when first got it but don recall it ever getting worse either what can say is used to have to top my s9 up bit at least once or twice day my s21 fe last all day and even have the battery saver setup so it only charge to 85 never did that with the s9 and even from 85 get full day no problem usually around 35 or so when am ready for bed the screen is great do leave on 120hz mode all the time also have dark mode turned on like how it look and dark thing on screen use less battery than bright white thing but yes battery is great now the camera my s9 actually had almost identical video make youtube video and the s9 did me very well in 4k by 30 or 60 do notice the s21 fe is ever so slightly better image it also ha better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that help out the picture are better for sure ve taken picture of people and shown them and they ve been like what phone is that the picture are sooooo good the s9 did well but the s21 fe is for sure an improvement used to use my g7x mark ii for most picture because it just wa better by far than my s9 now don think ever really need that camera anymore this phone produce awesome photo haven had single issue no glitch no nothing just smooth perfectly working phone did kind of like the s9 having the fingerprint reader on the back but quickly got used to the in screen reader it work fast and great apps load fast camera is on in an instant with double tap of the power button just really nothing to complain about would have kept my s9 another few year but am happy with the s21 fe and hope it last me 5 year a well great phone if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it for sure recommend it,5,Recommend
pixel 4a,i went from galaxy s7 to this pixel 4a 5 day ago so far like it it is very similar to the s7 in overall size but without the bezel the screen is bigger most function seem similar m not sure what the raf about pure android experience are about don trust and don use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader so just gave them middle star rating the speaker are loud enough for me and have some age related hearing deficit ve always used an att store to set up my phone before but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phone despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 year followed google online instruction for transferring the data from my s7 and they worked fine the only irritating thing wa that the direction said the box contained an adapter for attaching usb cable to usb micro it doesn it is an adapter for connecting full size usb to the usb in the box so had to go get full size usb to usb micro cable overall can see lot of difference between this phone and my previous s7 except that now get security update for android and the s7 no longer doe why pay 700 for flagship phone when this doe the job for half the price or much less and 5g give me break lot of hype and no benefit so far don expect to see benefit in my rural area for many year and it still doesn work any better than 4g lte in downtown denver where my wife office is so middle of the line phone work very well and this wa the best could find for my purpose,5,Recommend

cx 6.0bt,so have been using the current pair of cx 275s for more than 6 month now use them regularly on my daily commute of an hour to work on my bike a well a in the office for skype call which usually mean nearly 4 4 5 hour out of the 9 hour at work the sound quality is good however if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at they are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise cancellation is quite good at this price point the 2 year warranty that is provided make these the most bang for buck earphone if ever you face issue with the earphone a long a they are within the warranty period replacement is quite hassle free applies to the cx180 a well which owned earlier a well to sum it all up if you are looking for good pair of multi purpose earphone for regular use you can not go wrong with these,4,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,this phone is solid it interesting that in 2020 budget phone is 700 dollar but it is definitely great value for the money the camera aren a great a the regular s20 line up but they are solid upgrade coming from the s8 just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photo get very grainy in less than ideal condition battery life is solid work all week and when m not on my phone lot easily get 2 day and squeeze in few hour from the next day if really can get to another charger if have day off and m on the phone for hour can easily make it to the end of the day at 20 percent the screen is great color are bright and the quality 120 hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate the phone is definitely bigger and closer to the note 20 non ultra model in term of size so that take some getting used to touch could be bit better sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something the fingerprint reader is an optical one so it hit or miss sometimes have found that if pay attention to where place my finger it tends to recognize it more easily just never thought d miss the one on the s8 considering the poor placement of the thing the stereo speaker can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing one found on my old phone reviewer say that the sound is not a rich a the more premium version of this phone bit if you re coming from phone that is over 2 year old with only single speaker you ll enjoy them definitely get phone cover because the plastic back doe scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt a m finding out haptics are another area where samsung cut back on this model the vibration feel close to that of the s7 in cheap way to their credit they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on text box like that found in pixel just don expect solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the s20 model 6 gb of ram is plenty now but may wish had gotten phone with 8 gb in few year after some o update only time will tell it crazy time and hard to believe that phone price have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale it a no brainer and very easy to recommend,5,Recommend

watch ultra,i didn purchase this watch with my own money but wa lucky enough chase reward point but this is an expensive watch used to own an apple watch series 3 and wa looking for an upgrade wa either going to get series 9 or the new ultra 2 ended up splurging on the ultra 2 and honestly it an extremely good watch m personally very clumsy person and my series 3 looked like it ha been through war or two however the titanium make this watch super durable and almost resistant to dink and scratch another thing the battery life one of the best feature of this watch usually charge the batter every 1 5 day and if m lucky sometimes even 2 day the heart rate tracking ping lot more so you re able to get much more accurate tracking and this is great if you re into fitness m not really diver marathon runner etc but this watch for day to day use is definitely over kill if you re considering this watch would just recommend you figure out your priority on why you want it also love being able to use this for sleep tracking every night without needing charge beforehand overall if you have the money would say get it but if you re looking for better price series 9 or even older is the way to go,4,Recommend

galaxy tab a9+,let me tell you short story first m 37 year old now but back in 2016 got galaxy tab for christmas ve been using that same tablet for year now it been reliable and continues to function but it ha awful performance and apps are starting to freeze or crash it only gotten worse over time it only had 12gb of space and 1gb of ram it a shame but it wa time to put it to rest after dutiful amount of use want to play mobile game and it just wasn cutting it also like to read book on kindle and my book were taking 4gb of the meager space on that old tablet that poor tablet is now getting it much deserved permanent rest now fast forward to 2025 just got this new tablet because of it excellent value and m astounded by it it surprising how much power you are getting here along with the large bright screen it can run 2d or 3d game really well much better than you expect but it depends on the game 2d game are smooth a silk such a my current favorite dragon city a for 3d game raid shadow legend absolutely run amazing even on ultra setting and it quite shocking to behold for such cheap device but that game isn exactly the pinnacle of mobile graphic anymore is it don expect to run zenless zone zero or other more visually intensive game which play on my pc instead the game performance for most game alone make this tablet surprising value yet it also ha good battery life charge quickly with most modern charger and ha stable operating system don know if m just too used to using bad mobile device being mostly pc gamer with powerful gaming pc but you really can go wrong with the a9 a portable computer option,5,Recommend

tab m9,i recently purchased lenovo tablet and wanted to share my experience with it first and foremost want to clarify that my review is not directed at the seller they did their job in delivering the product promptly it important to note that seller have no control over the product itself decided on lenovo tablet because wa in need of device for both personal and work use and lenovo ha reputation for producing quality pc and laptop carefully examined the product spec on the lenovo website which indicated that the tablet had 32gb of storage expandable to 128gb with micro sd card however when the tablet arrived and went through the standard setup process including adding my google account and performing necessary update wa shocked to discover that only had 17gb of storage space remaining this wa before even installing the apps had planned to use inserted micro sd card and attempted to set it a expandable storage on top of the internal storage but to my disappointment the option wa nowhere to be found in the setting after some research on the lenovo website learned that the storage expansion feature had been removed in the latest system update rendering the micro sd card usable only for photo storage this left me frustrated a it nearly impossible to work with only 17gb of available storage on tablet the operating system and update had already consumed nearly half of the 32gb the tablet originally came with consequently promptly requested refund and opted to purchase samsung galaxy tab with 128gb of storage in conclusion if you re in the market for tablet would strongly advise against considering this lenovo tablet the unexpected removal of the storage expansion feature wa major disappointment and the limited storage capacity severely hindered it usability for my need,1,Not Recommend

iphone 12,for starter the price on these phone is great between having the reassurance of amazon buyer protection and the benefit of knowing the device ha been tested for performance it well worth it needed new phone fast after my cat knocked mine into the sink rice fixed it for while but it wa only temporary before it died altogether hate buying phone and avoid it whenever possible 99 of mine belonged to someone in my family first and wa good with that needless to say my cat didn wait for someone in my family to upgrade wa on my own this time okay that not entirely true my grandma had an iphone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime going from an iphone 11 pro max to an iphone 7 wa bad it wa too dam small in every possible way 32 gig of memory needed an upgrade fast my 11 year old wa bullying me relentlessly and that on me they had my old xr formerly my dad i scoured fb marketplace d decided upgrade little so could feel better about the switch didn want to feel backed me into corner by my cat recklessness would get slightly newer model in fun colour marketplace had plenty sending message after message from my iphone 7 worried this person seems too eager this one ha been posted so long want purple but the only purple one listed ha less storage space and the pretty green one ha small crack this guy life 2 hour from me and battery life errr last time checked it wa like 74 no can take screenshot of it it turned off cash only please etc so much pressure what happens if the thing doesn work that 300 down the drain knew couldn afford new but hated the idea of buying something used from stranger on facebook didn want to get scammed and also didn want to settle that when remembered good ol amazon maybe d check there just for funsies probably out of my budget but it couldn hurt sure enough refurbished device selling like new mostly same cost or less than what d found so far surely there wa catch read through everything tested by amazon includes all the spec unlocked can pick the colour the storage size the condition etc and could have it delivered to me tomorrow with warranty recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12 don come in yellow then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender the lavender would take an extra day to arrive mint it wa a promised it arrived the next day it wa in beautiful shape 128g mint green not single scratch 86 battery life all for less than would have paid to some stranger for 64g with some small scratch once my case and screen protector arrived excitedly set it up and synced my data oh no the face id didnt work after becoming used to facial recognition having that yanked away and dealing with 7 for over 2 week wa desperate for the convenience of face id had been using my fingerprint like caveman not to mention have blink 182 ticket and it specifically state facial recognition is required to access the mobile ticket idk if that true but needed face id googled contacted apple support fixing it could be upwards of 300 that almost what paid for the whole phone realllllly didn want to be stuck without phone again but also wanted one fully functioning so reached out to amazon support and explained the rep wa incredibly helpful a most amazon rep are and after bts failed she advised the ship wa 3rd party seller and she send message to them if they don fix it by insert date contact u back and we ll make this right she encouraged m ngl wa nervous didn have high hope having dealt with 3p seller on amazon in the past at least amazon had my back ig the concert wasn till july even without facial recognition it wa load better than the 7 could make do in the meantime the seller came in clutch though and my worry wa unwarranted they responded within minute they were receptive apologetic and more than willing to help a d anticipated they offered refund or exchange a soon a they received the return explained my concern with not having phone for several day or more and the merchant offered to overnight replacement a soon a the return wa dropped off could deal with one day without phone gratefully accepted that wa saturday night we made plan to catch up monday for the return instruction and for them to overnight it monday reached back out and they were ready to ship but they had no more green shock do you have purple no just blue white and black this wa huge bummer it silly know and the definition of first world problem but mean my change of heart about this whole phone thing hinged on the fun colour without it wa just person out 350 because my cat wa thirsty while wa watching youtube while washing dish needed cool colour plus d already gotten the matching case clear with mint green border it wasn even fun blue it wa dark serious navy blue it wa pretty and classy but wanted something fun even asked if he had any older model in yellow no luck they told me they be restocking in day or so still no green or purple came in ugh reality wa setting in wa going to have to settle it wa fine thought at least it would be fully functioning phone no wasn ready to let go they assured me could take my time to decide and asked if we could wait another week in case one came in if it didn then would choose from the option available messaged them wednesday afternoon bracing myself for the answer they got in purple yay they sent label dropped it off sent photo and had my new phone the next morning they said overnight shipping but wow d dropped off the return around 3pm and had the replacement by noon the next day didn even have my new case yet despite the barney esque colour scheme my mint green case created the lavender is gorgeous and m actually sort of glad the green didn work out don get me wrong the green is also gorgeous but in the end m glad ended up with the lavender wa overjoyed when wa prompted to set face id during setup worked brilliantly a did everything else great packaging no cosmetic flaw amazing battery life customer service wa great and best of all it purple can wait to pair it with the new case m so glad went this route where have some peace of mind a buyer m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me a insufferable a must have seemed making such fuss over colour preferenceif you re nervous buying phone used or refurbished too hopefully you can take comfort in knowing this seller is legit you receive good quality product and speaking from experience they ll gladly help resolve any issue you may run into,5,Recommend

galaxy s21 fe,just ordered my phone it came super quick at discount from amazon for 635 the phone is quick the camera look really cool on the back but m not fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in coming from lg google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best it feel really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app counter intuitive power off process it not the same a to power on wtf bixby suck to say the least lot of wireless half baked feature that are impractical but the phone seems reliable enough know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to black and white version limiting 5g network like how you can easily enable 5g if needed but who really need that much power and of course keeping no apps running in the background and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn vibrate itself to oblivion which is weird because the phone force lot of notification even after you turn them off or minimize them expected little cleaner software honestly would have preferred brand new s9 but couldn find anything that wasn refurbished turned the 120 hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting couple day on the regular love 4500 ma battery like the glasstic back but be warned there is slippery feel to it so go to ebay and grab quick 10 buck case to be safe overall m happy with the device the expandable storage is very nice and bought another 128 gig for 30 buck at target so have all the memory need and more just wish could switch to the google version of software but keep the samsung hardware because those pixel are looking weak watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful had this phone the price the value and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched the box is the phone and charger the speaker sound is little above average the fingerprint reader is solid and practical totally worth it,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,for the price being about third of current big name flagship phone this phone is great option but there are few thing missing that wish it had a an amateur photographer like having phone that can fill in for or replace pocket camera for those everyday picture when it isn convenient to carry full size dslr so the good news is that while the camera isn quite a nice a some of the most expensive phone out there it easily a good a most pocket camera a recently a just few year ago you will not be disappointed with the result from this camera but that doe lead into one of the phone drawback the lack of micro sd card slot without one you are limited to the internal storage of the phone itself and once that is full you ll need to backup your file and delete them from the phone to make room with 128 gb of internal storage most casual user will not run out of space quickly however unless you are recording ton of video all the time the lack of removable card slot is mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of usb otg adapter that will allow you to attach thumb drive or other usb accessory to the phone this will let you easily backup your file to an external drive to free up space on the phone if it becomes necessary it also allows you to easily connect usb accessory and peripheral like keyboard or projector for example the screen is good size extending almost to the edge but not quite wrapping around like galaxy phone the rear facing selfie camera is embedded in the screen so that a nice modern styling touch common to other current generation phone the front facing camera and flash led light are housed in pod on the back of the phone which protrudes approximately 1 5mm from the back surface this is sort of an unsightly break in an otherwise smooth aesthetically pleasing housing am sure the aftermarket will step up with phone case that protect this little pod from ding and scratch the screen itself curve down at the edge to meet thin plastic bezel to transition into the plastic case back additionally the fingerprint scanner is conveniently located in the center of the phone back where your index finger naturally land when holding the phone every other phone have used ha had occasional scanning error but this one ha unlocked easily every time m not sure if that mean it would be easy to fool the scanner but it is undoubtedly more convenient and so far is the best fingerprint scanner ve used on phone so google really nailed this feature the speaker sound little hollow when held in the hand listening to music but they improve when the phone is laid on hard surface like desk there is trrs audio in out jack so you can connect headphone speaker microphone or speaker mic headset among other thing some niche apps like certain amateur radio apps require this jack so it good that it present actual phone audio is excellent simply swapped my micro sim out of my old phone and into this one and it immediately recognized it and is able to make and receive call a if nothing changed get no complaint about low volume or poor sound from people on the other end of the line either another feature miss from my old phone is wifi calling this allows you to make and receive voice call over wifi router when phone network connection is unavailable it a great feature that have found very useful many time but sadly it doesn appear to be present in this phone at least not on the oem phone app screen clarity color and resolution are all too good to complain about touch sensitivity is good like most phone in the last 5 year or so there is no way for the end user to easily replace the battery and with the rapid development of android your phone processing power will probably be obsolete before you significantly wear out the battery typically charge my phone every night and take them off the charger in the morning ve had phone last for 3 year but that wa the absolute longest ve managed to go before upgrading and by that time my old phone wa struggling to run the current android build still really really wish modern phone still had provision for changing the battery okay so what else it a google phone so you are going to get cleaner version of android than you would on samsung or other brand because there isn going to be a many bloatware apps it doesn have qi charging coil inside so you won be able to use wireless charging this is feature liked from my other recent phone because you can put little piece of tape over the usb port to keep pocket lint from getting in and just charge it wirelessly with the 4a you ll have to plug it in to charge it and that mean the plug will have to be open to the element overall it a really nice phone when considered on it own when compared to other phone costing lot more it lack some feature but for the price you get lot of great feature and functionality if you are looking for an android phone that check almost all the box and will save you lot of money versus flagship phone this is solid choice,4,Recommend

pixel 4a,i had the pixel 3a xl prior to ordering this phone but my wife needed better phone so ordered this one and gave her my 3a xl a she wanted the larger size my biggest concern wa the screen size difference but with the slim bezel on the 4a the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a xl you can see slight difference when you hold them side to side but in practical term of use it very neglible a for the phone itself love it it ha the awesome camera have come to love with the pixel lineup the fingerprint reader is still in place it ha more memory and ram than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a xl wa while do have very large hand the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle and much easier to operate one handed prior to my pixel 3a xl had the huawei mate 10 pro which absolutely loved have also had nexus and galaxy phone a well a few other more budget friendly phone for the money this phone is an absolute slam dunk everything you need nothing you don full transparency am not gamer so can not attest to how it hold up in heavy gaming but beyond that it work wonderfully if there is any downside it is the battery not that it small have gotten through all day on more than one occasion however with my slightly more than average use do find myself needing to top off late in the evening the good news is that in a little a 15 min this thing will charge up 50 or more so it not huge deal if you are going to go out for the evening just plug it up while you are getting ready and you ll be more than good to go they claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone battery life over time so we ll see how that go but despite that it is still phone would recommend all day long especially when comparing to other phone in this price point oh and having just one color choice what doe that really matter especially when virtually all of u put some sort of case on the phone there a good variety of case to add color so don let that stop you,5,Recommend

pixel 4a,cheap inferior phone in all aspect except the camera and by cheap mean cheap the body and screen are decent however the speaker quality is so dismal am considering to selling it 4a is at least decent ish value for money and the camera punch above it weight initially got pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issue except it cost 650 the whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced miss the audio quality and material of my samsung galaxy s7 every minute and that is five year old phone the drop in quality is shocking if you use the phone a phone something designer at goggle probably don you ll want to hurl it through the window soon it is practically unusable a speaker phone which is something the competition doe usually very well the loudspeaker accentuates any minor issue participant may have with their line the one that is tad too bassy buzz and sound hollow faint line sound fainter etc samsung figured this out year back similarly you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones alarm medium volume between loudspeaker use and headphone use imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use then you switch to headphone to play song then someone call you your eardrum will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphone perhaps am too focussed on the audio quality but for me it is key function there is lot of hype about google product but substance is simply not there google sell you cheap iron designed by team who really do not know how to make it work together and good camera however the competition caught up with the latter a well am still considering selling this phone too not happy,2,Not Recommend

ipad 10th gen,warning read this first look for the asterisk in the text below read that area first before clicking on the buy button my ipad 9th generation ha served me well for the past few year but the battery life wa beginning to suffer and the screen had few scratch from daily use could have had the battery replaced but that seemed to average around 100 and that wa no go especially since wa offered just 90 on trade in so spending more just didn make sense now apple want 349 for the base 64gb unit but ve noticed that many store have reduced the price to 299 possibly because apple ha discontinued sale of the 9th generation and supply are starting to dry up so jumped at the chance to get newer version ve been good boy this year and saved my money so could afford this got mine in yellow since the better half ha hers in pink no confusing these two one thing you ll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimension are not much different from the earlier generation however look can be deceiving the screen go from 10 2 inch to 10 9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom and that begs the question how do close out apps without pressing that button the android way that how you slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them or choose the one you want to use those of you using iphones know this procedure well yet another question ve been asked where the fingerprint id if the button is gone it now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner d love to tell you that setup wa snap but d be lying this ipad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old ipad thought had dud called apple and they discovered this one wa lacking update from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing since my old ipad wa already on 18 1 it wa trying to force apps and setting to new ipad that couldn readily take it mind you apple verified this wa indeed brand new ipad and not refurb or customer return it had just been sitting around in warehouse for nearly 2 year so in short you ll have to do update first and then transfer from your old ipad and how do you do that sign in to your apple account instead of allowing transfer from your icloud or other ipad tell it you want to do thing manually at that point it ll do the update a required then you reset the ipad and start over however once the update are installed they stay forever now transferring from either the cloud or your open ipad should be breeze two hour breeze plan on plugging it in too you ll suck at least 30 of your battery doing just this procedure now back to the review overall operation are not drastically different from what could see however don use my ipad for heavy duty artistic work nor do play intense game for joe or jane everyday this ipad won present any significant performance change how about the screen look about the same to me battery life improved over my old tablet only because that battery wa on it way out but only time will tell if it is substantially better will give point to apple though for finally going to usb charger instead of the lightning variety wa getting tired of lugging different charger around now come the last question is this ipad worth the extra cost when you can still possibly find ipad 9 for 100 less yes and no yes if you can get this model for 299 at which point it just 50 more than the 9th generation come with bigger screen and us the readily accepted usb charger no if you have to pay full retail of 350 or so at that point you might want to live with the lightning charger and button at the bottom,4,Recommend

s2pghw-174,the control stopped working within 3 month of use after using for 10 minute they get disconnected automatically and the you have to charge them again to use and have to connect to power supply to switch on the earbuds bad quality they ate under warranty but you have to send the earphone to noida at cost of r 400 which you have to bear even my skullcandy method stopped working but bit later after using it for 10 month got replacement but they too have stopped working after 15 day of use do not buy skullcandy earphone better buy sennheiser momentum wired for r 4 5 5k quality is much better,1,Not Recommend

galaxy tab s10,i ve only had this tablet for short while and being the first tablet ve ever had can compare it to much but so far am really loving it the ai feature which think are new in this generation are really cool the way it help you straighten out your your handwriting is really helpful and fascinating how it work the ai can help you format your handwriting and create document from information you write down that being said the ai is not perfect in understanding my handwriting but should say that have really terrible penmanship so it no surprise that it doesn get it perfect it all quite mind boggling thinking about it potential us and know ve only scratched the surface when it come to the productivity benefit that the ai feature will assist me with a for the size of this tablet like it think the larger size would have been too big this one is just the right size for me can carry it around with me throughout the day without it feeling like m lugging tv screen around with me it quite light without feeling too light like it could break very easily it feel durable in the hand and feel comfortable taking it with me wherever go multitasking with this tablet is super fast there pretty much no lag time even when have multiple application open and ve even been able to do some light gaming emulation on it which wa surprised to be able to do didn think tablet could be used for gaming this is just the 256 gb version but it ha an expandable storage slot if remember correctly you can fit 1 5 tb micro sd card in it to expand your storage which intend to do this certainly isn a cheap product but you really get your money worth from what can tell look forward to discovering new and exciting feature about this tablet and if you can afford it id recommend anyone else to buy one when they can this is great product made by mainstream and well known company so potential buyer should not be concerned about the quality of the product they re getting would rate it 10 star if could but since can 5 star all the way,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s6 lite,the samsung galaxy s6 lite run into some performance issue especially when attempting to multitask 4 gb of ram is just too low for multimedia purpose the device performs decent enough it ha good display and enough performance to run lower end 2d game the design still feel reasonably modern esque in lot of thing in raw spec this thing isn that well positioned in the market the 128 gb version of the a9 when on sale go for 11 buck or so more and 8 gb of ram and 90hz display instead of 60 and that just direct samsung example however the main thing this device ha going for it is coming with remarkably solid stylus and performing well enough at thing involving that stylus lenovo is notorious for software issue there is no other device on the market with that combination of excellent stylus support software support and being outright dirt cheap relative to other more noteworthy stylus and tablet combo,4,Recommend

pixel 4a,though ve only had this pixel 4a few day it ha been great so far the phone came roughly 60 charged and a far a can see didn require any security update right away wa able to open the box and start set up right away without waiting for charging the instruction for set up were good the box ha the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minute or less it also included little tool thingy to help get the sim card out this wa nice and unexpected bonus that saved lot of grief the transfer of everything from the old pixel to the 4a wa smooth and didn take ton of time the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password and any other password for apps you had on the previous phone also some setting needed to be readjusted a of now don seem to have lost anything though 8 of my contact transferred without the name to clarify the number were there in recent text without name attached to them but wa able to read the previous text and determine whose number it wa so could add them a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text loved my flagship pixel but knew needed new one because the old one wasn being supported anymore and performance wa getting slower chose the pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the pixel don have all the bloatware that come with samsung and other brand don use fb or twitter or lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone wa huge deal for me like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on u also like the google keep for note and the google calendar since had these on previous phone and everything transferred to this pixel 4a smoothly another good factor is the price of the 4a this wa significant in our decision particularly because it seems to have everything need and not bunch of stuff don need or want an additional plus is the larger screen no bezel while still keeping the small size of the phone the screen look classy and it small enough to not be problem getting in and out of pocket or purse everything is faster and smoother than the old pixel the plastic hardware isn a big deal to me because use solid wallet case for my phone so protection is provided people don see the outside of the phone anyway there are few nice new bell and whistle to learn if you are going from an older pixel but they are good thing and nothing to cause great frustration so far m still struggling little with the gesture thingy and how to double tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out liked the way we did it on the old pixel better but am adjusting m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot supposedly one is for editing and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photo so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time sure hope google photo fix this issue soon m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the pixel 4a overall the upgrade from the flagship pixel or pixel one or whatever they call it now appears to have been good move,4,Recommend

series 10,this is my first apple watch and got it along with new iphone and airpods pro love the integration of all this tech without it being too complicated am still exploring the feature on this watch and am thankful for all of the thing it can do without having to keep taking out my phone to use a of now other than being an effective timepiece it is very useful in setting timer and getting notification about text and mail like the alarm multitude of changeable watch face and host of default apps appreciate the simple design and option without making this another smart device to just be glued to like cell phone or computer although it basically is small computer one thing didn expect to be using so much are the activity feature to track exactly that not that sit down all day even when working desk job at first it wa nifty to meet the default activity level but it ha helped me get back into the routine of exercising in the process at first thought it automatically tracked exercise but it doe not but you can define when you are starting type of exercise weight lifting running etc and then it ll keep track of your metric like heart rate and calorie burned like being able to get all of that info in addition to knowing ve done it keeping track of other health related thing ha been great and like with exercise m able to be more mindful of how much sleep get now it is also neat to be able to listen to music at time from my watch during cooking or office packing work but haven used this too often the 2 thing have to be critical of and didn see this anywhere before purchasing is the blood oxygen meter that is on this watch ha been disabled for this model pending issue apple ha to resolve might have at least paused in purchasing this and would ve like to have know this upfront it work fine on prior model but do your homework to see why the other thing have had problem with is siri is not always responsive on this watch for some reason it responsive when first turn it on but then siri doe respond generally an hour or so after that this is what have for now but ll update it a go one thing will have to update is how many more scratch will have on the watch face a of next time have been pretty careful but ha still managed to get several light and permanent scrape toward the top of the face thanks for reading and ll add more soon,4,Recommend

galaxy buds 3 pro ai,i am seriously freaked out do you remember the star trek movie where the nasty green bug is put into the prisoner ear if so you will understand have narrow ear canal and found that the medium one which it come fitted with were bit too large it wa difficult to get them removed and yes followed the direction and watched video on how to do it one of them came off finally so put the small one on again a directed put it in the ear and it felt odd removed it and you can guess what happened the bud cover remained in my ear canal thank heaven someone wa home to help me get it out because wa seriously panicking in 25 plus year of wearing ear bud have never had this happen if it had would never wear them again because obviously yuck bug the ear bud cover themselves are very odd they are very thin and the one couldn get off felt a if it would rip if pulled harder which is good given that the one changed felt secure and basically fell off in my ear there are only 3 pair total small medium and large with this price point anticipated more cover a with my master dynamic earbuds there were several pair in each size can see why they don want you to change the cover often but even with cleaning my experience ha been that eventually you need to replace them and here you would need to purchase another one in your preferred size they simply don compare to my d one at all waited on the charging case to turn green which again per instruction would mean they were both fully charged it ended up with only one charged and the other one completely dead again comparing them to the d one the case is simply inferior on mine there is light for each ear bud and one for the case itself that way you can see if all 3 piece have complete charge you can also tell from the app the percentage of charge remaining which is handy favor don know if the samsung app provides that information or not because didn get to that point but it should show on the case itself the case is okay it doesn feel nearly a sturdy a my d one nor doe it look anywhere near a good really don care how it look if they work but it is nice feature to have case that look like an expensive car doe one which you can immediately tell by the look and the feel that it is extremely well made my security app on the phone identified the samsung app a being dangerous so am going to uninstall it immediately samsung usually doe well with it app it wa only because have loved my samsung phone watch and television that decided to give these try the ear bud sound like they have potential but are not up to the standard would expect a the pro version from samsung have lost feeling on the end of some of my finger due to nerve damage in my neck which is why have stuck with d for year they have wonderful mechanical button which can easily manipulate wa willing to give these try because while not mechanical it wasn the universal one button which hate a can never tell if have pressed it the requisite number of time and end up advancing chapter turning them off ending call etc these may be wonderful but a knew wa returning them didn take the time to figure out the control plus to be honest didn want to put them back in after the bud cover came off spent hour yesterday reading review because couldn decide which pair to try between the samsung bower wilkin and sony like to purchase on prime day or other sell day because of the cost a loose thing all too often try to get the best price can having really good hearing and blessed with the curse or gift of hearing anything that is out of tune found early on that detested cheap ear bud still love my shure bud that are wired but it is pain to have the dangling cord all the time paid fortune for them in 2000 and they still sound better then any blue tooth one have ever tried but figured that would be the case listened to the sound on the charged one but that is not fair test so am not commenting at all on the sound think samsung ha the right idea but in going for so many feature they have skimped on some element and cut corner on the basic which you need to make any of the rest of it worth your time may try again if change are made but right now these fail mean when the case show green you would assume both were charged and that failed you can see there are going to be issue right away,1,Not Recommend

galaxy tab s10,i ll start this review by stating ve been an apple user for really long time use pc for work so feel immersed in both the apple and pc world wa excited to get this galaxy tab s10 to review overall m impressed with it and admit it will take me some time to get used to the operating system the hardware on this tablet is impressive it feel high quality in your hand it think and light for how big the screen is the screen itself is gorgeous and movie and photo look great on it the pen is impressive with how accurate and sensitive it is it much smaller than my apple pencil and seems to hold charge for long while m definitely not fan of magnetically attaching it to the back of the tablet m afraid ll lose it ve seen an advertisement for case that ha bump on the back to go around the pencil and hold it there until it needed and then the portion of the case fold back a flap to expose it for the user to grab ll have to look into finding case like that overall the tablet doe feel like it need case for protection a all great electronic device seem to nowadays admit m having harder time with the software on the tablet setup wa simple enough that didn have any problem figuring it out need to dig more through the setting to see if it possible to tap the screen to wake instead of having to press the wake button on the side the home screen is reserved for only the apps you specifically add a all new downloads go to screen that requires you to flip up to get them to show you can lump similar apps together into folder and then long press the folder or individual apps and say add to home screen then you can move it around the home screen wherever you like for me the biggest pain with every android device ve tried is the double account during the set up had to create samsung account and log in with my google account then you have two store you have to juggle try to only use google play store to find and download new apps this fragmentation is annoying to me coming from the apple environment where everything is in one place m sure android user would tell me this fragmentation is better for the user a it allows competition between company well m not sold also really hate giving all of my biometrics to google or samsung who will probably end up selling it feel like that kind of personal data is hopefully safer in apple hand who is always touting privacy is any corporation really safe again m impressed with the hardware and given time m sure ll adjust to the software if you re already an android fan this tablet should impress and delight you,4,Recommend

rockerz 255,to those who doesn get to know the realistic review about this product ve been using it for 2 day and understood the sound quality and f kin love these earphone noise cancellation is very good you can hear noise until you try to hear them comfortability you can listen for longer period of time it will start paining after 20 min these were not comfortable until removed the wing and had some old eartips which am using right now these are more comfortable to me and now can listen to 4 hour straight without paining battery life is excellent used for 2 day and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40 now the sound quality mids are average won miss any sound high treble or vocal is not up to the mark but if you adjust the equaliser setting then you can make it sound so amazing low bass is so powerful rockerz 255 wa only made for the bass lover guess their only focus wa on the bass these earphone have extra bass am saying this so many time because it literally ha so much bass the people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid a fun have used some high and mid end earphone like sony mdr xb55 with extra bass jbl t110 and oneplus bullet at first when heard thought made mistake by purchasing these earphone but when equalised it made it sound like some high end earphone and am very happy with the purchase now you will only like this if you didn have an high end earphone but if you have never heard an high end earphone and want some eargasm then must say that you should go with the product you ll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise,5,Recommend

galaxy tab s9+,i ve always bought the cheaper samsung series android tablet and they ve always disappointed in the long run the s9 is just so responsive and quick at everything it doe that think it worth the higher price the oled screen is excellent overall and it just joy to use tried to go the ipad route to see what all the hype wa about and bought the base model 9th gen about year ago it wa pretty good tablet with nice screen and decent speed but the apple ecosystem just wasn for me the s9 is better at everything and doesn have big black bar on the side of your video due to apple unique display ratio the 120hz screen on the s9 is amazing it made my ipad feel terrible to use when went back to it for comparison think most of all missed the google discover news feed swipe left when on home screen apple news is paid thing for most of the content and found myself using my android phone to get my my news feed v my apple tablet the google news app on ipad just wasn the same one thing really did like about the ipad wa the gesture turn out that android ha pretty much identical gesture in the display option and it the best of both world for me on the s9 now don think ll have to upgrade for quite while with how powerful this s9 is,5,Recommend
